You have a duty to make adjustments for disabled persons so that they’re not excluded from your service, making every reasonable attempt to provide access. The Royal National Institute of Blind People (RNIB) has a useful guide to the UK law and how it affects the accessibility of your site or service. Most accessibility testing is typically done after an accessibility audit has been conducted. If a participant has a range of needs it’s best to do accessibility testing in the participant’s own home. This is because: It’s often difficult to carry out accessibility testing early on in the process of service design. Your service must be fairly stable for it to be evaluated by people using assistive technologies, eg a screen reader will read out the contents of a web page, so the code needs to be well structured. Only do accessibility testing when: Full lab-based accessibility testing is not necessary for every project. An accessibility audit may be a more efficient and cost-effective way to review your service, depending on your typical user needs. Accessibility audits are an alternative to standard accessibility testing. An accessibility audit involves an accessibility expert reviewing your site or service, highlighting all accessibility issues and making recommendations for fixing them. They would typically use assistive software used by disabled web users (eg a screen reader) to effectively carry out the audit. See the W3C accessibility guidelines for further information. Accessibility audits are cheaper and quicker than accessibility testing, but rely primarily on the expertise of the person doing them. Include disabled participants as part of a wider user testing recruitment process. The numbers will be small, but aim to capture a range of disabilities and assistive technologies. Disabled participants are a harder to reach audience, so the cost of recruiting participants can be relatively expensive. Recruit participants through specialist organisations or agencies like the RNIB. Expect costs to increase if: Timings will vary, eg whether sessions are lab-based or structured in a ‘home environment’, but generally: These estimates are dependent on your project’s scope, and the availability of testing assets.","description":"Accessibility testing is very similar to usability testing, in that it is about making sure that a product or service is easy for its intended audience to use.

Blog post by Morgan Brown with a good discussion on user flows and conversion funnels There are various web analytics tools available to help you measure how people are using your service. Be sure to assess how well a particular tool meets your needs before deciding on which tools to use. It’s essential that your chosen analytics tools provide an open Application Programming Interface (API) with no restrictions on exporting data. Also, when deciding which analytics tool is most appropriate for your service, consider: For each of these criteria, identify which ones are fulfilled as part of the standard quoted package and what is charged for any additional features. The privacy and security of data is of absolute importance, so review your vendor’s privacy and security policy. Make sure your analytics solution and processes: As part of keeping your users’ data secure, find out: There are many digital/web analytics vendors in the marketplace, along with open source solutions. A search for ‘analytics tools comparison’ provides a number of useful resources where you can compare the capabilities and strengths of different services. See some more examples. Install and configure analytics tools that meet your needs. Where possible, use platforms that enable the data to be piped automatically into other systems. Use APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) as they will stop you from having to input data manually and allow the grouping of data across multiple platforms.

When building an API there is always a danger of building the wrong thing in the wrong way for the wrong people. This is especially a risk in the absence of a developer community driving the needs behind the API. The simplest way to ensure your API is useful and consumable is to build a website using your own API. Building a website leads to considering how to best model content and data in terms of bookmarkable resources, and ensures data is presented in human as well as machine-readable representations. Becoming a consumer of your own APIs not only validates your API, but exposes services on the web. Consider an API to be a part of a website. Provide links to machine-friendly formats from human readable pages, and enable agents to easily construct URLs which link to human-friendly representations of pages. Use standard formats for content, and follow established web patterns for authentication. Building a service to enjoy mass adoption and support from a wide, disparate community of developers and programming environments while being able to reach a worldwide audience is difficult. While proprietary and open technologies abound for machine-to-machine communication, none of them have the web’s interoperability, reach and ability to scale. Standards are powerful agreements, and nowhere are agreements more quickly established and adopted than on the web. Using HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) and URLs (uniform resource locator), the core technologies of the web, along with emergent standards such as JSON and OAuth changes a website from a retail shop window into a wholesaler, meeting our design principle to build digital services, not websites. Expose data as a set of resources, offering a clean URL for each thing, and each collection of things. Only use query strings for URLs with unordered parameters like options to search pages. Consider creating URLs for different granularity of resources. For example, /members.json could return a list of names, whilst /members.json?detail=full could return detailed information about each member in a list. These principles enable network effects which arise through linking and allow information published beyond the web, sent in alerts email, SMS, XMPP and other messages, to link back to the canonical content on the web. Ensure all HTTP GET requests are safe and actions which change state are conducted using a POST, PUT or DELETE method. Use PUT and DELETE with caution, as they are commonly blocked by firewalls, intranet proxies, hotel Wi-Fi and mobile operators: always offer a POST alternative. Avoid HTTP methods which are not well defined, such as PATCH. Offer content for each thing as a human-readable HTML, with links to content in alternative machine-readable representations: Where possible, also offer other formats most suited to a specific domain, such as: This advice builds on our more general guidance on data and content publication formats. Include hyperlinks to alternative representations as link headers as well as in content. Consider also encoding metadata inside HTML content using semantic markup: Microformats, RDFa or schema.org. The representations supported by an API for input will vary depending upon the complexity of the action, but where possible should include application/x-www-form-urlencoded to allow the construction of simple POST forms. Use names for fields, formats and path segments in a URL path consistently across your API. Establish conventions others may easily follow and anticipate. Where possible, reuse names widely used elsewhere on the web, as with the Microformats naming policy. Building a website which exposes the data through links, and services through HTML forms encourages exploration and leads to discovery through hypertext. Provide documentation for your API using examples. Collect how people are using your API, especially link to any open source projects for projects, wrappers and programming language libraries. Provide simple ways to experiment, as with The Guardian API explorer. Be clear in the web pages and other documentation as to the security, availability, rate-limiting, expected responsiveness of the platform and the provenance of data, so consumers can plan their commitment to using your API. Lower the barriers to others using your data: don’t demand registration or API keys for public data. Open data increases the number of people able to use your data and service, and leads to feedback loops where consumers become motivated to resolve issues at source, feeding back issues and correction to your service and its data. Where content is sensitive, or requires authentication, use HTTPS encryption (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) and a standard authentication such as basic authentication or OAuth, depending upon the sensitivity of your content. Build for forwards compatibility by gracefully handling content that is unexpected. The robustness principle – Postel’s Law – explains the ability for the web and internet to evolve, though you shouldn’t ignore protocol errors, corrupted, or invalidly formatted content. Preserve backwards compatibility with existing consumers of your API, by sending expected fields and employing sensible default values for missing fields. Eschew changes to the semantics of content, eg don’t change a title field from meaning the title of the page, to meaning the prefix for a name to the person’s job title. Where a revolutionary change is unavoidable, communicate a breaking change by changing the URL. When changing URLs, continue to honour old consumers, possibly use a redirection. Cool URIs don’t change. Don’t do everything yourself (you can’t). Sometimes the functionality your service needs will be provided by other parts of your organisation, other government departments or by reliable third parties via APIs. Most modern digital services are built on top of a wide range of APIs. This allows each part of the service to focus on its core responsibility rather than constantly reinventing the wheel. When consuming APIs you should be careful to keep the integration with your code clean and distinct. This is important to ensure that you can swap between providers or update to new versions of an API without making substantial changes to your core code. At GDS we encourage the use of adapter code that’s entirely focused on interfacing with the system and mapping code. This will provide the linkage between your code’s domain model and the concepts and services provided by the API. You should consider carefully how you intend to test your integration with the service. In day-to-day development you’ll want to be able to test your code without making (computationally or potentially financially) costly calls out to third party services, so you should come up with a way of providing mock versions of those APIs. For full system tests, however, you’ll want to test the full flow including the third-party service so an automated mechanism should be built for that. Many of the GOV.UK publishing applications send emails to provide alerts for content designers. When running tests we don’t want to send lots of fake emails so we swap the normal email adapter for one that logs the emails it would have sent. This lets us test our code is doing the right thing without depending on external services. Parts of our Performance Platform code involve significant interactions with Google Analytics. It wouldn’t be practical to test this by sending events to Google, waiting for them to be processed, and then reviewing the results. Our developers therefore built a mock service that can be run alongside tests and provides a dummy version of Google’s API that lets us check the right data is being sent. Our publishing systems make use of a single sign-on service. In most of our tests the interaction with that service are mocked so the applications’ tests can be run in isolation, but we also have a suite of smoke tests that run in our preview environment and use dummy accounts to ensure that the full authentication and authorisation flow is working. The Licence Application Tool integrates with a number of third-party payment services. It makes use of test accounts with those services to verify it is able to communicate with them and is sending the right data to complete payments. By depending on a third party API you could very easily be tying your service’s availability to that of the third party. In some cases that may be acceptable, but often you will want to ensure that you have a fallback plan in place. The details of that fallback will vary according to your service. It may be that you’ll need to offer the user the opportunity to use an alternative service, or queue the action to take place later. That could be an automated queue with software that monitors it and retries transactions, or it could be a manual queue where someone follows up to collect further details. You should be clear with your users about what’s happening. If a third-party payment provider isn’t available you might queue the transaction to try again later. That will mean you can’t offer users the same guarantee that their payment will be processed correctly and you should tell them so.","description":"Martha Lane Fox’s report called for government to act as a “wholesaler, as well as the retail shop front, for services and content by mandating the development and opening up of Application Programme Interfaces (APIs) to third parties.”","link":"/service-manual/making-software/apis.html"},{"_type":"manual_section","organisations":["government-digital-service"],"manual":"/service-manual","title":"Government Service Design Manual: Asset hosts","indexable_content":"Asset hosts To provide the fastest possible experience for our users it’s usually a good idea to serve assets (stylesheets, JavaScript, images) from a separate domain name.

Where more than one team is involved in developing a service, these assurers are useful because they can: If assurers are involved with the service on an ongoing basis they can add more value than if they’re only involved periodically. They should engage early with the service manager and people who govern. The Digital by Default Service Standard is a set of criteria that has to be met by all new or redesigned transactional government services.  Services with more than 100,000 transactions per year are assessed by the Government Digital Service (GDS). Services with under 100,000 transactions a year are assessed by a team within their own department.  Assessments happen at 3 points in the development of a service: This is an assurance and approval process: if the GDS assessment panel doesn’t pass a service, it won’t be awarded the standard or appear on GOV.UK. After an assessment, the panel provides feedback to the service team, including about where they might need to improve in order to meet the standard. Teams can use the criteria in the standard and the service manual to help focus and prioritise their work. If assurers from within the organisation are available, they can also use the service standard as a basis for their review activities. Under Cabinet Office spend controls GDS assures all technology related spending over published thresholds. You should speak to GDS early on to agree appropriate points for approval and to get advice on shaping your expenditure request.  The Major Projects Authority (MPA)  provides independent assurance on major projects, which are defined as those which: The MPA assures projects through Gateway Reviews or Project Assessment Reviews. Gateway Reviews take place at significant points during a procurement process, whereas Project Assessment Reviews are bespoke, focussed and timed to meet the specific assurance needs of your service.

Updates can be as short as you like, allowing you to tell readers about subtle changes to a service’s design or new features added to a tool, while also offering you a platform for longer pieces of writing that describe significant changes to policy or approach. The Inside GOV.UK blog and the MOJ Digital blog are great examples of how teams are already talking about their work in the open. A good blog post can do the work of dozens of emails. Finding the right way of sharing a piece of information once – describing a change to how a feature works for example, or talking about upcoming work – can save a huge amount of effort in finding new ways of saying roughly the same thing. More importantly, it means there’s a consistent frame of reference for talking about a subject. If people have been told slightly different things then they might come away with a different understanding of how something works – not something likely to make your life simpler, clearer and faster. Whatever you’re writing about, make sure the most important information is in the title and the opening sentence. Readers may only see the summaries of your posts on the home page, or their feed reader, or in the email alerts, and it’s important they have a clear understanding of what you’re doing. Short updates can still go into a bit of detail about what you’re doing and why you’re doing it, whether that’s changing the colour of a button or re-writing a whole section of guidance. Keeping posts short makes them simpler to write, and also means it’ll be easier to get input from the people you work with. Though the frequency with which you blog will often vary you should aim to publish a new post at least once a week. A well-chosen illustration or photo can add important context or information for your readers. The GOV.UK blogging platform is fairly flexible. You can embed tweets, slide decks and videos as well as images, all media that make your message just a little bit easier to comprehend. The GOV.UK content design guidance is an invaluable tool for writers. They’re full of carefully researched tips for clear, concise prose which seeks to make your writing easier to understand. In particular, make use of subheadings and bullet points within your blog posts to make them quicker to read. And make use of the ‘words to avoid’ list – it’s there to make sure writers stay clear no matter the audience. The style guide doesn’t mean you can’t be warm, candid or personal. You should be all of these things. It’s important that you’re accountable for the things you write.

CAPTCHAs introduce significant problems to online services: Additionally, if a 3rd party CAPTCHA service is used, there are further problems to consider: Many of the risks that CAPTCHAs are aimed to mitigate can be addressed in other ways: It’s important to note that even with a CAPTCHA in place bots will still get through due to advances in computer imaging and the use of CAPTCHA farms. A combination of different approaches generally gives the best results.","description":"CAPTCHA stands for Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart.

It’s also a method service teams can use to sort and arrange user needs. The method is very simple to use: it involves simply writing the needs or topics on pieces of card (maximum of around 50) and asking representative users to organise these into groups, which are then given a meaningful label. 15 to 30 users are recommended: a minimum of 15 users will give reasonable confidence in the results, but any more than 30 gives diminishing returns. It is also possible to conduct a closed card sort, whereby the users are given pre-determined categories and are asked to allocate each card to one of these categories. Open card sorts are most suitable for identifying how users think about information, in order to build an information architecture. Closed card sorts are most suitable for validating an information architecture. The analysis of card sorting can be difficult if no clear categories emerge. It can also be difficult to conduct a card sort on a very large website with a broad scope of content (eg GOV.UK) since the maximum number of cards may not be representative of all of the content. Card sorts can also be conducted using an online tool such as OptimalSort. This is a cheap and effective way of reaching a large sample of users without needing to bring them into a dedicated lab facility for the study.","description":"Card sorting is a research method used to understand the way that the intended users of a website naturally organise or think about different types of information or content.

Make it clear that there is a task to perform on this page and that the transaction is not complete until they confirm that the information is correct. Provide links back to the pages containing information they can change. The user should be returned to the ‘Check your answers’ page once they’ve updated the information (and any other questions triggered by their updated response). Don’t just write the questions and answers out as they were originally given. Reword them for this particular format and context. For example, the individual elements of an address do not need labelling, and long questions can often be rewritten as shorter statements. The submit button should fully state the action it performs, eg ‘Change your tax details’ or ‘Send your claim form’. You don’t need an explicit declaration checkbox as long as it’s made clear what will happen. Add hidden text to the ‘Change’ links, so that they make sense when read out of content by screen readers.

Ensure systems, information, processes and networks are designed around the needs of the service user, providing as simple and as integrated an experience as possible. Be very clear who the users are and how to engage with them and ensure their needs are met. Demonstrate value for money in your business case and articulate the options considered in a full and objective appraisal. All new or redesigned digital services, both public facing and for internal use meet the Digital by Default Service Standard. All new or redesigned networks adopt the Network Principles Ensure a level-playing field for open source software when you choose technology. Demonstrate an active and fair consideration of using open source software – taking account of the total lifetime cost of ownership of the solution, including exit and transition costs. Use open standards, complying with any that are compulsory for use in government, unless you’ve been granted an exemption. Use common government platforms (eg GOV.UK, Performance Platform, GOV.UK Verify (identity assurance), Digital Marketplace, shared services) where available. Make data open by default, while minimising and securing personal data, or data restricted for national security reasons. Public data should be proactively published in a manner consistent with the Open Data principles: structured, machine-readable, and discoverable through data.gov.uk. Users should have access to, and control over, their own personal data. Establish the sensitivity of information held in accordance with the Security Classification Policy, establish legal responsibilities, develop user friendly, proportionate and justifiable security controls according to the Security Policy Framework. Separate commodity from niche needs and purchase accordingly. Use cost-effective commodity services for infrastructure and utility business activities like office productivity (word processing, spreadsheets and presentation software, email, scheduling and collaboration). Identify and acquire capabilities rather than infrastructure where services required are bespoke/innovative. Ensure that any procurement is designed to encourage competition and follows published Government Procurement Policy. Programmes will be ‘disaggregated’ to meet business and operational needs – broken down into components supported by the market to enable many suppliers to bid. Contract lengths for services should be kept to the minimum level necessary to ensure commercial flexibility. Objectively evaluate potential public cloud solutions first – before you consider any other option. In order to do this you will need to identify the capabilities and services that make up your technology design, and demonstrate that the solution chosen represents best value for money. Purchase networking and telephony services through the soon to be announced Network Services framework or its predecessors PSN Connectivity framework and PSN Services framework. Purchase Data Centre capacity through Crown Hosting Service. Applications should be accessible through a browser to ensure your solution will work for any end user device. Ensure best environmental practices, whether in-house or via external suppliers, including compliance with Greening Government ICT. Any software licence agreements must evidence actual user needs – there should be no default continuation of enterprise licence deals or specification of products or brands. Share resources: services, information, data and software components must be shared in order to encourage reuse, avoid duplication and prevent redundant investments. Reuse includes the use of existing services and capabilities that already exist outside of government where they provide best value for money, eg identity verification, fraud and debt management, cloud-based commodity services. Align to the shared services strategy for HR, procurement, finance and payroll. Plan on using an agile process, starting with the user need. Waterfall should only be used by exception and where it can be shown to better meet user need. Projects may need the best of both formal and agile methods, playing to their respective strengths: producing successful IT services is about knowing when to use the right tool at the right time. Demonstrate that adequate capability is available in your organisation – you shouldn’t outsource strategic decision-making or service accountability. If the necessary capability does not exist in-house, then you need to evidence a plan for developing or recruiting people with the right skills and experience. Implement effective procedures for the use and management of information (both structured and unstructured) through its entire lifecycle.

Automated testing is an important part of our overall approach to quality but only one part of it. There are various approaches to writing automated tests. In particular there are differences in when people expect to write tests, and in the ways that they’re expressed. Many practitioners insist that automated tests should always be written before the code they seek to test (to ensure careful design and ‘just enough’ code) while others are happier writing tests after the fact. Tests that are written before the code offer a number of advantages and that approach should be encouraged, but the most important thing is that the whole team works to ensure there are automated tests, that those tests are understood as an asset of the product and that they help you ensure the quality of your code. It is common to talk about behaviour-driven development (BDD) as an alternative approach to test-driven development. BDD is an approach to automated testing that focuses on expressing tests in the “ubiquitous language” that the whole team should share when discussing problems. There are various tools that have been created to facilitate BDD but it is an approach that can be implemented using most traditional tools. Any code written for your service should have a set of tests operating at 2 levels: This requires broad tests that run through high-level functionality end-to-end, making sure that the pieces of the system come together to provide the right service. A developer in your team should be able to describe the steps in any acceptance test to the product/service manager in a way that makes sense to them and matches how they expect the service to be used (or abused!) This concentrates on the specific details of the code, making sure that each separate unit of code does what is expected of it by: Write tests whenever a bug is discovered. Then write a test to reproduce the bug before it’s fixed, so you can confirm that the bug has been fixed and make sure that it isn’t reintroduced later. GDS aim to write a first set of tests at the start of working on a feature. Acceptance tests that describe the expected end-to-end behaviour of code make sure that: These tests are often described as ‘happy path’ or ‘sad path’: GDS start with happy path tests and a few simple sad path tests, and then add more sad path tests as understanding of the code and its dependencies develops. Developers are expected to run tests regularly, especially before sharing new code. Examine the code in tests as part of the code review process, and regularly run tests in a shared continuous integration system. This gives the whole team a chance to see how they’re performing.","description":"GDS use automated testing to:","link":"/service-manual/making-software/code-testing.html"},{"_type":"manual_section","organisations":["government-digital-service"],"manual":"/service-manual","title":"Government Service Design Manual: Community user groups","indexable_content":"How research communities work Where and how you might use it When not to use Participants rapid speed (questions are answered in real time, research team can react rapidly to internal demands) cost effective when up and running flexibility availability rich outputs (visual content such as video is regularly used and is impactful) deep insights raises profile of research internally when insight is relevant and timely An online research community is a website that allows pre-selected respondents to interact with each other and complete a series of tasks. The types of community differ, and vary in openness, permanency and size. A typical community will be private, often have between 300-500 members and focus on building relationships between participants. This type of community offers a great source of deep insight over long periods of time. The tasks given to a research community differ in format and can include; online forums, blogs, polls, surveys, instant chat and more. Tasks are usually creative, and ask different questions relating to the research objective/s. Research communities can be used for a wide range of projects such as audience understanding, diary studies, concept development or simply idea generation. They allow a business to get close to users and offer meaningful dialogue between an organisation and its customers. The key benefits are: Communities require constant management. Participants need to be kept engaged, which means daily interaction, new questions and inventive approaches to maintain their interest. The community needs constant moderation, usually by a research manager or third party research agency. The quality of community members is paramount. Their feedback needs to be quality checked and panel attrition needs to be monitored on an on-going basis to ensure fresh ideas. Participants can be obtained using public postings on websites, email groups and social media, or via third party sample companies.","description":"An online research community is a website that allows pre-selected respondents to interact with each other and complete a series of tasks.","link":"/service-manual/user-centred-design/user-research/community-user-groups.html"},{"_type":"manual_section","organisations":["government-digital-service"],"manual":"/service-manual","title":"Government Service Design Manual: Confirmation pages","indexable_content":"Code Guidance Implementation Research a reference number (if there is one) details of what happens next and when contact details for the service links to related information and services a prompt to give feedback on the service a way of saving a record of the transaction (eg as a PDF) Where further action is required by the users, should this pattern be used?

Continuous delivery is about producing regular iterations of your software that’s ready to be released (deployed), though you don’t have to release these iterations to the public. Producing regular iterations makes it easier for you to: If your software isn’t ready to be used then it’s not creating any real value. Treat it as stock piling up – and stock is waste. The Lean software development philosophy tells us to: Test all iterations of your software, either through public user testing or automated testing (using separate software to perform the testing). Automate your deployment process so you are forced to fully understand it. Then any issues with moving code from your version control system into production (when it’s gone live) can be dealt with early on. Automating it early also means that code will be tested and any bugs fixed so that releases become frequent, low-risk, almost boring events. Don’t plan production release slots far in advance. You can’t be certain what will be ready in 6 months’ time. Make your release planning simpler – make sure it’s flexible enough that any feature or update to your software can be deployed when it’s ready. Then, if a feature needs to miss a release slot, it can easily be rescheduled for tomorrow or next week, rather than in 6 months, or more if the next slot is already full. Another advantage is being able to quickly respond to security patches or similar changes in underlying  libraries or frameworks used by your application. You can quickly make a change and watch the update flow through the various gates in your deployment pipeline, confident that nothing has been broken. What happens to code between it being written by a developer and deployed to production is known as the deployment pipeline. Understand your end-to-end deployment pipeline. Knowing how it works and how each element works together will have implications for: The deployment pipeline has 4 stages: When your developer checks into version control (where all code, including previous versions, are stored), a range of tests should be run against the latest version of the code. Any quick, easy-to-identify defects, like compile errors or unit test failures will be found at this stage. If the tests pass, the code progresses to the next stage and should be considered for release into production. Send the code to a shared sandbox (testing) environment. This is the first environment where the application is deployed and run. It’s also the first stage where it can be visually inspected for quality by anybody on the team. Make the sandbox environment as similar to the production (live) version as far as is practical. For example, if production uses Postgres, the sandbox should also use Postgres and not another database like MySQL or SQLite. The purpose is to find any defects in the code. If a defect is found, stop the version of the code at this stage. If it passes the sandbox environment it can move on to further specialist testing environments. You may need to perform additional testing for specialist requirements, like load and performance testing, penetration testing, or accessibility testing. The amount of environments you’ll need will depend on the requirements and conditions of your individual projects.

This guide covers how to use cookies on government services, but the principles also apply to other technologies, like HTML5 local storage. Minimise the use of cookies in your service, storing the smallest amount of information that you need for as short a time as necessary to provide a good service to users. If your service needs to store cookies, you need to make sure that this can be explained simply and clearly, in a way that the majority of users can understand.

The GOV.UK cookies page is an example of how to do this. You must link back to your service’s cookies page from the footer of your website. Your service information page must also link to the GOV.UK cookies page. Your service must also tell users on their first visit that cookies are used and regularly remind them of this. This is particularly important when your service relies on implied consent.

It should not be implemented in combination with the other two approaches and is not guaranteed to block all mistypes. Don’t disable paste on password fields.

Help users who have forgotten their password to reset it. Email is not a secure channel. Sending passwords by email is a bad idea. Instead, email a link or code to the address or phone number registered on the account that the user can use to create a new password. These are not particularly effective. The information they ask for is either too obscure and therefore just as hard to remember as a password, or it’s easy to find out (mother’s maiden name), or it’s unstable (favourite colour). Password reminders are a bad idea because they encourage users to reveal information about their password and they don’t work for very strong passwords involving random strings of characters.

Let people use as much of your service as possible before they need to create an account. For example, most shopping cart sites let you browse without having to create an account first.  If people can avoid creating an account at all – even better. For consistency with other GOV.UK services, use the phrase ‘Create an account’ on the appropriate screens rather than ‘Register’, ‘Sign-up’ or something else. Similarly, use labels like ‘Create a username’ and ‘Create a password’ rather than ‘Username’ and ‘Password’, so people understand that they’re not being asked to enter existing ones. Creating an account is rarely a user goal. People come to your service to use it not to create an account – your calls to action should reflect this. Make the choice between creating an account and signing in explicit. Presenting the options side by side is not enough – people will miss one of them or not understand the difference. If you can, ask people if they’ve used the service before and then direct them to either sign in or create an account.

Well structured Microsoft Word documents make good source documents for conversion to PDF. When a source document is converted into PDF it is tagged. The PDF tag tree reflects the structure of the document, and it’s this structure that assistive technologies like screen readers use to navigate the document. Use the styles and features available in Word to format your content and give it structure. This will make it easier to convert your source document into PDF because it lays the groundwork for the PDF tag tree. Use the heading styles in Word to create a logical document structure. Don’t increase the size of text or make it bold to create the appearance of headings. Treat your document like a book: It should have one title (level one heading) and multiple chapters (level two headings). Within each chapter there may be multiple sections (level three headings) and sub sections (level four headings). Use the list styles in Word to group together related items. If the items follow a specific sequence, use a numbered list instead. Don’t use punctuation or other markers to create the illusion of a list. If your document is longer than a few pages, use Word to automatically create a table of contents based on your heading structure. Don’t use lists and links to manually create a table of contents. Use left aligned text (unless the language of your document is read right to left). Don’t use justified text in your document. Choose a sans serif font and use the styles in Word to set it as the default, with a minimum size of 12pt. If you need to include footnotes or other text of a smaller size, increase the size of the body text to 14pt rather than reducing the size of any text below 12pt. Don’t use chunks of italicised or capitalised text, and don’t underline text unless it’s a link. Use foreground/background colours for text that have a good contrast ratio. The 4.5:1 ratio recommended by the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0 is a good minimum. Don’t use colour or shape as the only way to identify something in your document. Use text labels or descriptions instead. Use tables with column headings to display data. Don’t use tables to make cosmetic changes to the layout of the document. Use Word to add text descriptions to all important images in the document. Make sure the text description includes all the information contained within, or conveyed by, the image. Use Adobe Acrobat Pro to convert your Word document into PDF. Use the Convert to PDF option under the Adobe menu in Microsoft Word to do this. This will ensure that Acrobat picks up the accessibility you have built into your source document. Set the language of the document. Go to File > Properties > Advanced and select a language from the Language menu. If the PDF is written in Welsh, type CY into the box. All content must be tagged, marked as an artefact (background content), or removed from the tag tree. Use the Tags panel to review and edit the tag tree. If the PDF was converted from a well structured Word document, the tag tree should require little editing. If the PDF contains form fields, use Advanced > Accessibility > Touch up reading order to check they can be navigated with the tab key in a logical order. If the tab order needs improving, use the Order panel to drag and drop the fields into the correct order. Use the Tags panel to review and edit the reading order of the PDF. Don’t rely on the visual order of the PDF. The reading order is based on the structure of the PDF tag tree, which may not match the visual content order. Use View > Zoom > Reflow then check that the PDF still has a logical reading order. Note: It can sometimes be difficult to guarantee a logical reflow order for PDFs with complex content. Go to Advanced > Accessibility > Touch up reading order and check that all images have text descriptions. If the text descriptions were present in the source Word document and the Convert to PDF option was used, the text descriptions should already be present in the PDF. Remove empty tags from the tag tree. Use the Tags panel to highlight and delete any empty tags from the tag tree. Tag decorative content elements as artefacts. Use Advanced > Accessibility > Touch up reading order to select a decorative element, and use the Background button to make the element an artefact. Use the Tags panel to check the structure of data tables. The <table>, <tr> and <td> tags should be used to give data tables the proper structure. Use the Tags panel to check that links are active. Active links should be tagged with the <link> tag. Use File > Preference > Accessibility to set a high contrast colour scheme, and check the PDF remains readable. It may not be possible to make high contrast mode work in all PDFs, in which case you should be prepared to make a high contrast version available on request. Display the document title instead of the file name. Go to File > Properties > Initial view and select Document title from the Show drop down box. Once all the above steps have been taken, the PDF should be checked before it is published. Go to Advanced > Accessibility and select Full check. The PDF should pass the full check for WCAG 2.0 Level AA without any warnings. Ask a screen reader user to read through the PDF. If no-one is available to do this, use one of the following options instead. Non Visual Desktop Access (NVDA) is a free open source screen reader for Windows. It can be installed to the desktop or run from a portable USB thumb drive. With NVDA running, open the PDF and use the following commands to check the PDF: These commands will also work with the JAWS screen reader from Freedom Scientific. VoiceOver is the integrated screen reader with Mac OS X and all iOS devices. In Mac OS X turn VoiceOver on (or off again) using Command + F5.

Improving the way that you produce digital services is more about cultural and behavioural change than it is about IT. Technology alone will not be able to improve public services. Your digital services are based on user needs, not on organisation structures and processes. You have: To create better public services you’ll need to change existing behaviours and cultures, and successfully transition to new ways of working. You may need to develop skills within your team and keep up to date on new methods and technologies. It may also be necessary to change your physical working environment to get the best out of your team. You may need to radically change governance and management structures and will need to run projects in a more agile way. You’ll need an effective approach to information management, ensuring you adhere to the high level direction and guidance provided in the Information Principles. You’ll need to build relationships with new suppliers that you may have found through new procurement routes, such as the G-Cloud framework. It may be necessary and more cost-effective to write-off previous financial investments, so you’ll need courage and conviction to stop spending on old, legacy systems. The Cabinet Office, through spending controls, has a strong preference against extending contracts to support legacy systems. At the very least you’ll need an exit management strategy that sets out a plan for how you will significantly reduce any dependence on outdated technology. The cost of maintaining out-of-date technology that isn’t fit for purpose could far outweigh the cost of changing to a more suitable technology that better meets user needs. If you’re in this position, it’s also likely that the architecture and hosting of your existing estate may need to be rethought. You may come across inertia or resistance when you try to make necessary changes to your technology or how your service is provided. Your existing supplier base will tend to resist change – and the more successful a supplier has been working under the old model, and the more entrenched it is, the greater this resistance is likely to be. The changes needed will often be more successfully initiated and produced by those not encumbered by past success – new market entrants and those traditionally closed out from government work, like small or medium-sized businesses. You may find that you have become locked-in to a particular contract or technology. As part of your consideration of the total cost of ownership of a particular solution, you should have estimated the cost of exit at the start of implementation. If you try to move and find that cost is a barrier, any unlocking costs that you have identified must be associated with the incumbent supplier/system and not be considered as part of the cost of a new solution. Building on open standards or selecting products which use them will help you to avoid this problem in the future. If you have incumbent suppliers, it’s important that you understand and anticipate their likely reaction as they struggle to maintain the status quo and resist change. Incumbent suppliers will have data that reflects the past success of their business models and the way their business worked. They will be less certain about the future and may be concerned about the weakening of their market share and their exposure to genuine, open competition. The rewards and culture of these companies are likely to be built on their current business model. That will reinforce their internal resistance to change. It’s difficult for them to persuade shareholders and financial investors to replace a well-understood, if obsolete, business model with an approach that favours the treatment of some IT products as commodities. The IT as utility market is not yet fully established, so they will be uncertain about it even though this model might bring them higher profits on lower revenues. You’ll also see similar resistance in-house, where many staff may have long grown accustomed to old ways of working. It’s important that as a leader you provide the assistance and mentoring they need to help update their skills and experience. Some may have become dependent on external suppliers’ advice. Some may even have built their career on accreditation in a single supplier’s technologies. Flexible technology and services give service managers the ability evolve services and make them responsive to users’ needs. It also avoids costly and more risky big bang changes. Reducing the risk of lock-in to suppliers, software, service and support, or too old and inefficient IT, means that you have the ability to choose what best meets the outcomes you are looking for at a sustainable and competitive cost and at a timescale that suits you. GOV.UK is an example of how this works in practice. On the technology side, we set up hosting to build the beta of GOV.UK and then transferred it to a new supplier on the G-Cloud framework before launch. In early 2014, the infrastructure team at GDS migrated GOV.UK to a new hosting environment. Sam Sharpe wrote a blog post on the technical aspects of the migration and Carl Massa explained the project in a video. G-Cloud is the procurement framework intended for purchasing Infrastructure as a Service, Platform as a Service and Software as a Service products.

To do that, we need to have a consistent visual grammar, for use both within GDS and across government. This guide sets out 4 principles of good data presentation, with easy to follow checklists to help you achieve this. For context, we’ve added examples of how the principles have been employed at GDS. The principles and examples found in this guide are likely to evolve as we find new challenges and applications for them. There are many examples of best practice style guides already in place. For example, The Economist has a clearly defined house style that allows its readers to readily identify and understand their visualisations. They publish a new visualisation every day in their Graphic Detail. This guide attempts to build on the best practice from a range of organisations. The GOV.UK Performance Platform helps the government make decisions based on data, often presented through innovative visualisations (built using D3.js). The example below compares weekly visitors to GOV.UK with the two main websites it replaced.  To effectively tell the story behind the numbers, you need to understand both your audience and the data. Only use visualisations if they make the story clearer. In many cases, a good table or words may communicate better than a visualisation. If there are very few data points (eg top rate income tax down 5%, all other rates unchanged), it’s clearer to write a sentence than draw a picture. If every item must be read precisely (to several decimal places) then a table is best. A good table will be clear and uncluttered. The data should be easy to read with the same decimal places or rounded and sorted into a logical order. Don’t use too many different types of font, and make sure your data is referenced. But visualisations often are the right answer and the data is the most important feature. It should tell its own story and it’s best to not try to say too much in one go. Keep charts simple, cutting down on unnecessary items and jargon.  Explanatory text will be needed in some cases, but it should not simply repeat the story being told in the visualisation. A well written chart title can reinforce the story of the data and reduce the amount of additional text needed. Choosing the right visualisation will help the data tell its own story and give powerful insight. There are many ways of displaying information visually.  Most computer programmes come with a range of visualisations. There also visualisation tools available online: for example, this blog showcases some free ones and GDS has produced a guide to infographics Each chart has its own strength. Below are the core 5 with templates (a Google spreadsheet of these is available):  Strengths - comparing items, or a small number of time periods.  Strengths - comparing items, especially if they have long names or many items.  Strengths - comparing over time or between variables for a single item (eg site traffic vs site performance)  Strengths - simple share of total. Use with caution as column or bar charts are often better. Limit to 2 segments to avoid confusion.  Strengths - relationships between variables where there are many items (eg volume vs cost for numerous transactions) There is more help on choosing the right chart here. It is important to not confuse your audience. Choosing the correct visualisation is important and at GDS we reviewed what was being used in the performance dashboard. As the example below shows, Pie charts with many items are not clear. We used a stacked bar chart to better represent the data.   Keep in mind these useful tips when creating your charts: Keeping your visualisation simple will help the data tell its own story. Chartjunk is anything in your visualisation using ink that actively reduces clarity. Avoid: Know your audience so you give the right amount of supporting information. External or non-technical audiences will need more explanation but internal or expert audiences may find this tedious. Don’t use the text to simply repeat what’s being said by the data. Visualisations should avoid too much data. Only include what’s relevant. If the trend is obvious, don’t include a trendline. Sometimes it may be more effective to focus on high-value items only (if you’re being selective, be open and clear about this). Poor colour choice can change how the data is perceived in a visualisation. For example, red is strongly associated with negative performance so is best avoided for positive/normal figures. Colour blindness makes it difficult for a user to differentiate between data sets. Labelling charts directly and different line styles can help. If your visualisations are likely to be printed it’s important the colours work in greyscale as not all users will have high quality printers. The example below from the GDS senior management dashboard shows how avoiding chart junk and limiting the number of datasets can enhance your visualisation.  The legend accounts for a quarter of display space. The Y axis quotes £ and not £m. The segments are profiles and proportionate for each time period, so the bright colouring adds no extra detail. The mix of bar and line is confusing with so much information in the chart.  The stacked column gave a level of detail which wasn’t needed. This has been rationalised to best suit the audience. Axes have been standardised. The legend has been relocated giving the chart more space. Heavy grid lines and axes have been removed to give a clearer display. “We want transparency to become an absolutely core part of every bit of government business.” - Francis Maude Being open and transparent supports the Open Data White Paper. Similarly, our Open Public Services agenda is built on transparency. Sourcing data builds trust and credibility. Providing contact information shows ownership but also helps collaboration and information sharing. When presenting data be aware of axes and scales. Data can be misrepresented by only showing a selection if it isn’t clear why an extract has been chosen. Consider where the visualisation might be published. For example, if published alongside other visualisations, the reader is likely to assume the scales are consistent. This might change how your data is perceived.

Wong’s The Wall Street Journal, Guide to Information Graphics details the do’s and don’ts of presenting data. Edward Tufte’s The Visual Display of Quantitative Information is a seminal work on data visualisations and introduces the concept of chartjunk. Here is a video of Edward Tufte discussing his theories on visual thinking and analytical design. This article from the Peltier Tech blog covers the ten chart design principles.

Choose a format appropriate for the kind of date you’re asking about. For capturing memorable dates like dates of birth, the simplest option is to provide text fields for users to type the date in. For example: Calendar controls are not particularly useful for known dates and some users struggle with select boxes. We’re currently recommending using three fields as it’s easier to reliably validate than a single field. Don’t automatically tab between fields, as this can be unexpected behaviour that clashes with normal keyboard controls, and confuses users. Tip: If you want to trigger the num-pad on iPhones, add a pattern attribute to the input element like this: pattern=\"[0-9]*\" If you require a date to be provided EXACTLY as it’s given on another document (a passport or credit card for example), then it’s easier for users to copy the date across if the format is the same. If you don’t need an exact date and users are likely to struggle to remember it (for example the date you started your first job), make sure you allow users to enter approximate dates like ‘June 1996’. Some dates make most sense relative to today’s date or another date. This is particularly common when booking appointments of some kind. In these cases it helps if you let users enter or select relative dates like ‘tomorrow’ or ‘4 days later’. If the day of the week is important, show this as well.  Calendar controls are only appropriate for near past or future dates, where the day of the week is relevant. Their main use case is for appointment booking. If you also need to show information like availability, embed the calendar in the page and make it large enough for the information to be readable. A calendar control that depends on JavaScript should never be the only input option. The default date format to use is this one: Periods of time should be formatted like this: When you’re validating dates, remember to check the following: Discuss this page on Hackpad","description":"Not all dates are the same.

Those with the title of designer may have a particular focus on one or more specific design disciplines – interaction, graphic, UX – but a good digital service needs talented, flexible designers to help build user-centred products. Designers, user researchers and front-end developers should work together in one team, designing in-browser. This is a better way of working, avoiding silos and ensuring that decisions are made with complete awareness of the implications. As a result, the people you hire should already have worked like this, or at least understand it. Depending on the types of project you are tackling you may require a team of designers with a range of different skills. A good first hire for a team tends to be a strong interaction designer, however adding designers with graphic design skills and designers who also have a background in undertaking user research can also give your team additional flexibility and capabilities. We strongly believe that design and user experience is the responsibility of the entire team and must be considered from the outset of the project through to and beyond going live. UX includes how fast the servers are, to how the copy is written, to how the layout is implemented in code, and what the structure of the URLs is. It’s worth looking at Frances Berriman’s talk on this. When building a team ask to see examples of work and ask the designers to explain their practical contribution. You should look for the designer to share stories and documentation that demonstrates how they have worked closely with other members of the team including developers, content designers, user researchers and stakeholders in an agile and iterative way. When evaluating their design work, it is important that the designer can explain a strong rationale for their design decision making that is based in supporting user needs. This ability to explain their rationale convincingly is more important than their ability to show polished wireframes or designs in their portfolio. Often a lack of polished designs in a portfolio can indicate that a designer is highly collaborative or has strong development skills, so take care not to focus only on polished comps or layouts. You should also ask the designer to talk about any significant differences between the design they present in their portfolio and the actual live design. It is important that designers create appropriate work and are able to persuade stakeholders and their team to make good design decisions.

A team of skilled developers will be able to make sure that happens in an efficient and transparent way, and to help continually improve the service by identifying new tools and techniques and removing technical bottlenecks. No digital service can be effectively built, delivered, owned and operated without the technical skills to understand and improve the software enabling it. In order to provide the best service to your users it is vital that you are in a position to rapidly tailor that software to their needs and to the efficient running of the underlying systems. Developers will be able to work directly on those services, but are also an important part of service innovation as they bring ideas, generate prototypes and contribute to a rounded team.  Once a service is live the need for developers continues. There will always be technical optimisations that can be made – faster and more responsive systems, acting to mitigate the risks of a constantly changing security environment – but as you respond to new or more clearly understood user needs the software will need to adapt. As the policy and other context around a service changes the software may need to integrate with new systems or provide new features and a development team can help ensure that work is pro-active. A great developer: You would expect any developer to: It’s really important that your team is clear as to who makes technical decisions. Everyone on the team will have useful knowledge, skills and experience to bring to bear and you will need an agreed way to understand that input and make a call. Some teams accomplish that by appointing a Tech Lead or delegating certain decisions to a Technical Architect, others will put that responsibility in other roles. The important thing is that clear technical decisions be made by people equipped to understand the trade-offs involved. As your team grows it is likely that you will find a range of skills and experience.

What is DevOps? (and the wall of confusion) There’s no such thing as a “DevOps Team” DevOps is a cultural and professional movement in response to the mistakes commonly made by large organisations. Often organisations will have very separate units for: In extreme cases these units may be: Communication costs between these units, and their individual incentives, leads to slow delivery and a mountain of interconnected processes. This is what DevOps aims to correct. It is not a methodology or framework, but a set of principles and a willingness to break down silos. Specifically DevOps is all about: DevOps needs a change in attitude so shared ownership and collaboration are the common working practices in building and managing a service. This culture change is especially important for established organisations. Many business processes are ready to be automated. Automation removes manual, error-prone tasks – allowing people to concentrate on the quality of the service. Common areas that benefit from automation are: Data can be incredibly powerful for implementing change, especially when it’s used to get people from different groups involved in the quality of the end-to-end service delivery. Collecting information from different teams and being able to compare it across former silos can implement change on its own. People from different backgrounds (ie development and operations) often have different, but overlapping skill sets. Sharing between groups will spread an understanding of the different areas behind a successful service, so encourage it. Resolving issues will then be more about working together and not negotiating contracts. The quality of your service will be compromised if teams can’t work together, specifically: The root cause is often functional silos; when one group owns a specific area (say quality) it’s easy for other areas to assume that it’s no longer their concern. This attitude is toxic, especially in areas such as: High quality digital services need to be able to adapt quickly to user needs, and this can only happen with close collaboration between different groups. Make sure the groups in your team: DevOps isn’t a project management methodology, but use these good habits in your organisation. While not unique to DevOps, they help with breaking down silos when used with the above principles: Like agile, the term DevOps is often used for marketing or promotional purposes.

These questions should be open ended, and structured in a manner that will help elicit information from respondents in a sensible flow. As suggested by the name, discussion guides should be used as a guide to the discussion, and in comparison with a structured questionnaire, questions and areas for coverage should not read out verbatim.

Some email addresses are very long. Your email field should be able to fit at least 95% of email addresses. Two-thirds of the page width should be enough to do this, but analyse your user data to be sure. An email address is personal data that can easily be abused. Help to reassure users by making it clear what you will and won’t do with their address. This will also help users with multiple email addresses choose which one to provide. If a valid email address is required then you should help your users enter it correctly. The following techniques can help. Check that what they’ve entered conforms to the basic email address format. Check for common typos like ‘gnail’ instead of ‘gmail’ (read a case study here). Users may have a perfectly good reason for pasting an email address (for example if it’s very long). By doing this you may capture some accidental mis-types. It’s not failsafe though – users can make the same mistake twice, especially if they’re typing quickly (or just misremembered their email address). It also adds additional effort on to your users. An alternative way of helping users spot a mistyped email address is to play it back to them. Make sure it’s obvious how to correct any errors they might spot. If email is an integral part of your service, you can confirm whether the user has access to the email address they give you using an email confirmation loop.

Email confirmation loops can be a very disruptive user experience, forcing people to wait and then switch from a website to email and back again. They may not have access to their email at that point in time. Confirmation loops tend to increase drop-off rates, because some users struggle to complete the loop. They don’t notice the email, or it goes in to their spam folder, or they give up on the service before the email arrives. You decision should be based in part on what information you intend to send by email. Consider just helping users enter their email correctly instead. An email confirmation loop verifies that the address supplied by the user is a real one, but doesn’t verify that they alone own that address, or that they check it regularly.  Some users may supply temporary addresses as a way of getting around confirmation loops. Other people may share their account with someone else, or the account may have been hacked. For added security you can set an expiry date on the email, so that the link can’t be used after a certain time period. If the user attempts to use an expired link then they should be told this and given an opportunity to re-send a new link. There are two versions of the email confirmation loop. In the ‘blocking’ version the user cannot use the service until they have completed the loop. In the ‘non-blocking’ version they can continue to use the service, but will be reminded regularly that they need to confirm their email. Some functionality may not be available until they have done this. Blocking loops have a slightly simpler flow, but if the users can’t complete the loop they’re unable to use the service at all. It’s especially important that the emails are sent instantly. Non-blocking loops require more careful design, and you can’t guarantee that all users emails are confirmed, but there’s no risk that the loop will stop people from accessing your service. Some services start users in a non-blocking loop initially and then transition to a blocking loop. Use the phrase ‘Activate your account’ to describe the process of confirming an email address. The activate your account page should be shown immediately after the user provides their email address, or if they try to sign in before confirming their email. It should: For blocking loops this should be the only page the user sees if they try to sign in before activating their account. For non-blocking loops, if a user signs in before activating their account, you should: When a user clicks on the link in the activation email take them to a page that confirms that they have activated their account.

The aim is to gather insight into how people live; what they do; how they use things; or what they need in their everyday or professional lives. Ethnographic research relies on techniques such as observation, video diaries, photographs, contextual interviews, and analysis of artefacts such as for example devices, tools or paper forms that might be used as part of a person’s job. Observations can be made at home, at work, or in leisure environments. People can be studied with their family, on their own, with work colleagues, or as part of a group of friends. Often one participant may be recruited, but several more may be studied as part of that person’s family or friends. Data collection can range from a 4-5 hour contextual interview, through to following a participant for several days, or even a longitudinal study over several weeks or months to investigate, for example, how a particular product or service might be used over time. It doesn’t necessarily involve ‘full immersion’ in a person’s life: it can involve a depth interview in a person’s home or it might involve a person simply maintaining their own video diary over a period of time. Ethnographic research can provide extremely rich insight into ‘real life’ behaviour, and can be used to identify new or currently unmet user needs. This approach is most valuable at the beginning of a project when there is a need to understand real end user needs, or to understand the constraints of using a new product or service by a particular audience. Ethnographic research can provide a significant amount of qualitative data, and analysis can be time consuming. NOTE: The term ‘ethnographic’ can be misused, it’s currently a bit of a ‘buzzword’ with some agencies who may not fully understand the approach.  It is recommended that a specialist agency is used, who can demonstrate successful case studies (collecting and analysing the data). In principle, anyone could participate in this type of research. As with any user research, the recruitment of suitable participants is key. The full implications of the research should be fully explained to potential participants, as some may not feel comfortable with this level of intrusion in their lives. Depending on the study needs and the approach, but 6-8 weeks from briefing to results can provide rich insight. It may take time to build trust with participants, and the analysis period needs to be sufficient to be thorough.

An ‘expert’ usability evaluator can assess a product (or web site) against a known set of ‘heuristics’, or usability guidelines (best practice). An alternative approach is to conduct a ‘cognitive walkthrough’ against specific use cases or scenarios. Ideally two usability experts will conduct the review independently, and then meet to discuss and agree the findings before making recommendations to the service manager. A list of widely accepted (although not necessarily validated) heuristics are provided by Jakob Nielsen or an alternative set can be found in the International Standard ISO 9241. A ‘cognitive walkthrough’ is a usability inspection that aims to identify usability issues by focusing on how easy it is for users to accomplish specific tasks with the system (or website). This method starts with identifying the user goals, then conducting a task analysis to specify the sequence of steps or actions required to achieve each task. The usability expert, along with designers and developers, then walks through these identified steps to assess the extent to which a user can achieve their goal. Both of these approaches can be used to evaluate an existing product or website, or as a quick, low cost method of evaluating a product in development. These approaches can be considered to be ‘better than nothing’, but will never provide the same quality insight as testing with real end users. However, a competent usability specialist will often identify issues that are subsequently seen in traditional user testing or in actual use. Some agencies conduct expert reviews as the first step of all usability projects. The fundamental weakness of any expert review is that it doesn’t involve use by real end users. Some people may therefore consider this to be purely opinion, but input from an experienced usability expert is better than no user testing at all.

A focus group is normally made up of 6-12 people, although sometimes mini groups are favoured (4-5 people) as they can lead to a greater depth of discussion. 1:1 interviews are conducted by a moderator with a single respondent, and sometimes these are conducted over the phone. Interviews and discussion groups are both facilitated by a trained moderator using a specially designed topic guide in order to ensure the discussion is focused and keeps on topic. Sessions normally last 1-2 hours and will often involve participants being shown stimulus – eg communications materials to inform discussion, and sessions may include interactive techniques eg role play scenarios. Focus groups and 1:1 interviews are useful techniques for exploring and mapping reasons for attitudes and behaviour, understanding how target audiences approach issues or may be encouraged to change. They also enable participants reactions to be monitored, and the moderator to probe interesting issues when necessary. Dedicated viewing facilities are often used that enable sessions to be recorded, and interested parties can observe the sessions (often via a two way mirror) in a separate room to the participants. This often results in the research having more credibility as interested parties will have been able to view the sessions, and witness the findings first hand – this also means key issues can be acted upon quicker as observers can feed straight back to their teams. Some sessions take place in community settings, encouraging less confident/harder-to-reach audiences to attend. Focus groups can also be conducted online. The number of groups is often dictated by the budget available, but the average project will have 4 to 6 groups, with larger ones having between 10 and 20. Besides budget, other factors that influence the number of groups used are the number of potential users groups that need to be covered, and the number of geographic areas. Focus groups and 1:1 interviews can be expensive compared with other types of research, while the small samples size means that findings are not statistically significant. There is, therefore, a risk of generalising across audience groups. Analysis of the sessions can also be time consuming. Moderators also need to build a rapport with respondents. If he or she fails to do this, and can’t control the group adequately, it can result in the sessions being dominated by one or two participants, and biased data being collected. Participants can be obtained from the general population and hard to reach groups.","description":"Focus groups, mini groups, and 1:1 interviews involve unstructured interviews or group discussion.","link":"/service-manual/user-centred-design/user-research/focus-groups-mini-groups-interviews.html"},{"_type":"manual_section","organisations":["government-digital-service"],"manual":"/service-manual","title":"Government Service Design Manual: Form structure","indexable_content":"1.

Before you start, make a list of all the questions you want to ask. For each question, you need to know: We call this list a ‘question protocol’; it’s different from the form itself, because it’s about how you use the answers. A question protocol forces you (and your department) to question why you’re asking users for each item of information, and gives you a way of challenging and pushing back if you need to. Once you have a question protocol you can start to decide how to order the questions. Structure the form so most users have a simple, quick path. Use branching questions to hide questions from people who don’t need to answer them. You’ll need to make difficult decisions about which users to prioritise, so make sure you have good data from the business about them. Most public-facing government services are used infrequently, by people with a broad range of digital skills and confidence. Because of this, we recommend that you: ‘One thing’ could be: We’ve found that this approach works for both high and low confidence internet users, and that people are generally very tolerant of clicking through multiple pages. Having only one thing on a page helps people to: It also helps you to: ‘One question’ doesn’t necessarily mean one form field. For example, date of birth is best captured with three text fields. For page titles you can use either a question or a statement. For example - ‘What is your date of birth?’ or just ‘Date of birth’. Use questions or statements consistently to help users get into a rhythm of answering. This lets them focus on the content of the questions rather than their presentation. Try to ask questions that might result in the user being ineligible for the service as soon as possible, so you don’t waste people’s time. For a good example of this approach, try the Register to vote service on GOV.UK (you can get to the last page without submitting any data).

You’ll need to get approval at different phases when you build your service.  Discovery is right at the start of your project — where you research user needs, find out about any policy or technological constraints and get a picture of what your first prototypes will explore. During the alpha phase, you start building and testing those prototypes. To start discovery, you need approval for discovery and alpha. This means: investment approval from your department Cabinet Office spend control approval to spend on external resources, eg on suppliers You don’t normally need a detailed business case for discovery and alpha because they inform the development of the bigger investment case for beta and live. As a guide, discovery and alpha together shouldn’t cost over £750,000. If you plan to go above this, you should question whether you’ve sized the discovery and alpha correctly — if you do exceed this figure you’ll need a detailed business case. The beta phase is where you build a fully working prototype that you’ll test in public. The live phase is when your public beta has been tested and is ready to release. To go to beta you’ll need approval for beta and live.

Sex is a protected characteristic in the Equalities Act 2010. Gender isn’t, but the closely related concept of gender reassignment is. Treating people differently because of protected characteristics may be discrimination and may therefore be illegal. The act applies to the public sector and to services. Many people consider that questions about gender or sex are sensitive or inappropriate in a government context.  For people who are coming to terms with differences between their sex and gender, being asked about sex or gender may be particularly difficult and stressful.  Sex is biologically determined, and can be male, female, or intersex. Gender is a social construct about how people choose to present themselves in the world.  Trying to guess someone’s gender from a title is a bad idea because: Do not collect title as a required answer, due to the huge variety of titles in use. Gender is not a clearly defined ‘female’ or ‘male’ construct. It can include a range of identities in-between, and labels identifying these identities are still in a state of flux.  Some people may also be in transition, or move between different genders frequently. This makes it difficult to provide sensible options on a form.  For a few people, being forced to declare themselves as ‘female’ or ‘male’ may lead to dropping out of a form.  Historically, the assumption was that ‘men’ came before ‘women’ so the traditional order of options has been ‘male first’. This is no-longer appropriate as an automatic assumption. Please test with ‘female’ as the first option and report your findings on the wiki. It is only appropriate to ask for someone’s sex in a context where the biological data is necessary – typically, only for medical transactions. Unfortunately, we also have to recognise that we have to deal with legislation that may require ‘sex’ as a legal identifier. If you must ask for ‘sex’ then ask for ‘female’, ‘male’ and at least 1 of the remaining options, depending on circumstances: In the UK an Early Day Motion has been submitted in support of giving legal recognition to those who do not associate with a particular gender. In Germany, the Personal Status Law (paragraph 22) states that if a child’s sex cannot be determined at birth then the law allows for birth to be registered with the ‘sex’ box left blank. The Australian Government guidelines on sex and gender specify that when a government form asks about sex or gender, then it must provide these options: M (male), F (female) or X (Indeterminate/Intersex/Unspecified).

As soon as you have more than one team you’ll need shared planning, coordination and management of dependencies. This can mean a small increase in the amount of work, but don’t lose sight of the aim to have self organising, self managed teams. Scaling up doesn’t mean you need to add more people who govern; don’t complicate governance processes as you scale. You need to: make sure everyone understands the service vision and goals — especially new starters have teams plan together and think about what they’ll individually be responsible for where possible look at splitting work by theme, product or feature sets to minimise dependencies between teams think about whether it makes sense to share specialist people across teams, eg software architects and people working in security, policy or finance It’s better for multiple teams to be sitting in the same location — just as a single team benefits from this. When your teams don’t sit together: there are communication overheads there’s less informal communication and learning it’s harder to establish a shared culture This is particularly problematic when ‘business’ and delivery team members don’t sit together. If you can’t find a suitable shared space or team members live and work in different parts of the country, split the team. There are ways to minimise the problems separation causes, eg: video communication social media regular face-to-face meetings You can also get team representatives together in a cross team stand up (sometimes called a ‘stand up of stand ups’), where the following questions are explored: what has your team done since we last met? what will your team do before we meet again? is anything slowing your team down or getting in their way? are you about to do something that will affect another team’s plans? The last question helps teams to gain early sight of any dependencies or cross team issues that will need joint remedy. The frequency of these meetings is best determined by the teams and the pace of delivery. It’s important to plan for changes in team composition. Planning activities include:  consulting with the delivery team on who should be added when making sure the team can devote time to integrating new people making sure new people will have the tools they need to be productive on the day they arrive When you have more teams, don’t force them to work in exactly the same way as each other.

Even if it hasn’t changed, it’s important to revisit it in this phase as your team is likely to change or expand.  Doing this helps ensure everyone understands: what the service is why it’s important who it’s important to Review your governance arrangements Your team may take on a different shape as you start to build a prototype. As the team and goals change, make sure your governance team is still closely involved in supporting the team delivering the service. Identify and mitigate risks A crucial outcome of the alpha phase is that the team can identify the biggest risks to the service early on. Things that may help manage risks include using iterations to test incrementally and adding critical risks to the team wall. Find out more about identifying risks during alpha. Create a roadmap based on the outcome of your discovery We use roadmaps to describe the high level direction a service will take. Roadmaps need a firm vision with goals that are focused on outcomes.  It’s important to establish goals during discovery and create the roadmap with the team. The roadmap will inform the business case. Your roadmap may identify that the service is broken up into a number of segments, each of which have their own beta phase and then get separately put into live service. Find out more about identifying goals during alpha. Measure your progress You should use the measures you agreed to use during discovery. If you decide to measure progress in a different way, you need to make sure this is really necessary and get everyone involved in the decision to change. The team wall is how delivery teams manage their work — it’s essential everyone understands how the wall can help show progress. Go to show and tells A show and tell is where the team demonstrates progress by showing what they’ve been doing. It’s an opportunity to ensure user needs are being met.  The team may ask for help in unblocking something, or need a decision on something that needs your steer. Clarify benefits By testing prototypes with users you will verify whether or not the expected benefits can be realised. Some examples of benefits from digital services include: making it easier and quicker for users to register for and use a service  reduction of print and post costs more accurate user data cost reduction through labour saving Identify costs for beta and live Consider the expected lifetime of the service and costs for: people software technical infrastructure  team environment (facilities) and support continuous improvement assisted digital Revisit procurement needs You need to evaluate the size of team you need for beta and get costs for things like cloud services and tools needed for development so you can build a set of costs for spend approval and the business case. Rate cards and price lists available in procurement frameworks can help you estimate costs, as can actual spend data of similar services. Develop your business case and get approval If you haven’t already appointed a senior responsible officer (SRO), should appoint one now to sponsor the business case. This could be the service manager or someone else senior in the business. Seek funding for your digital service with a business case for further investment approval and Cabinet Office spend control approvals. You can’t start beta until you have an approved business case. Digital by default service standard assessment The Digital by Default Service Standard is a set of criteria for digital teams building government services to meet. Meeting the standard will mean digital services are of a consistently high quality.  This includes creating services that are easily improved, safe, secure and fulfill user needs. The result of an assessment could mean you continue to build towards a beta service, make some changes and come back for re-assessment or stop what you are doing. Plan for assurance In addition to the in built assurance activities at the team level (eg pairing, show and tells, user research and retrospectives), you can use your department’s internal assurance team to provide an independent view. A valuable side-effect of this assurance can be identifying potential opportunities and dependencies with other departmental initiatives that could impact your service development. If your service is, or is part of, a major project then you’ll have developed an Integrated Approval and Assurance Plan that defines appropriate assurance activities. In these circumstances you’d also expect to have a Major Projects Authority (MPA) Project Assessment Review towards the end of alpha to help the shaping of beta and the development and approval of your business case. Even if you’re not subject to MPA assurance, you should include assurance and approval points in your service roadmap. Unblock and support the team Teams need help with things that slow them down and are outside of their control. During alpha they’ll need you to be closely involved on a daily basis, so that you can help them with decisions, encouragement and ideas. You’ll need to anticipate problems and make decisions promptly to avoid slowing down delivery and ensure a seamless transition from the alpha to beta phase. Revisit the size and shape of the team You’ll probably need more user researchers, developers and designers to help deliver your alpha, particularly as you start building prototypes of the service. You may also need finance people, economists and analysts to help with your business case. During alpha you’ll also need to work out the team structure and composition you need for beta and beyond.  Consider if you need to scale At this point your team may need to think about adding more people and how that will affect delivery. Review team needs As your team changes, it’s important to revisit their needs. New skills may mean new tools, and new people will certainly mean more space and equipment.

You’ll have investigated risks and gained a more thorough understanding of your users and their needs. Review governance You should review the governance arrangements you’ll need for the beta service, bearing in mind that you may have multiple teams working towards a common set of objectives. Keep your governance arrangements as lightweight as possible whilst still supporting development of the service. Plan for known risks A successful alpha will have investigated most of the areas of risk and uncertainty in your service. Use this to inform your roadmap and try to identify and plan for risks that are specific to beta. Including risks in your roadmap will help you focus on the risks that are relevant to delivery.

Adjust your procurement accordingly. Get department investment approval and Cabinet Office spend approval for beta and live Seek further approval for funding your digital service as necessary. Digital by Default Service Standard assessment The Digital by Default Service Standard (DbDSS) is a set of criteria for digital teams building government services to meet. Meeting the standard will mean digital services are of a consistently high quality. This includes creating services that are easily improved, safe, secure and fulfill user needs. The result of an assessment could mean you continue to build towards a beta service, make some changes and come back for re-assessment or stop what you are doing. Assurance and audit As you move through beta towards live, the typical assurance processes to get your business ready to run the live service are applicable. There is a strong link to the DbDSS assessment at the beta to live point and it’s worth considering any additional assurance that may be beneficial beyond the scope of that assessment.  This is likely to focus more on the business impact of introducing the new service, or new digital service channel, and any associated transition arrangements. Any audit of beta should focus on the team and governance process and behaviour, not the actual decisions taken. The team and its governance bodies can only be expected to make decisions based on what’s known at the time. A decision may be found to be wrong as better information becomes available, eg through testing with users.  If your service development team is working well, it will quickly learn and modify its approach.

If your service is in response to a new policy, make sure you consider the digital service during the policy impact assessment.  You need to set up proportionate governance for discovery – you’ll need to consider: delivery and assurance funding and approvals the service delivery team Governance during the discovery phase will include a small team of senior people acting as sponsors and advisors. They’ll be closely involved with the delivery team exploring the service needs during discovery. Plan for your discovery Before discovery, you need to plan and gather sufficient information to make sure what you’re doing fits with the wider organisational strategy.  You need to: develop a service vision laying out the overall intention of the service, including who the users are and why the service is important  agree a handful of discovery goals and how to measure progress find out who the stakeholders are set up initial governance and communicate what people can expect from it Goals and measures are likely to be incomplete and there may be little evidence on which to base targets. Your service vision will probably evolve too. Go to show and tells ‘Seeing the thing’ at show and tells is an important governance activity – this is useful because: the team can demonstrate progress towards meeting discovery goals you can see how the well they are working together you can support and help unblock things that are slowing them down Even early in the life of a service, there’s a lot that the team can show to demonstrate the outcomes of their work. Identify benefits In discovery you’ll spend some time exploring and understanding what benefits the service could bring to users and government. You’ll do this through lots of user research and a close analysis of policies, laws and business needs.  If you don’t identify benefits from the start, the chances of them being realised are reduced. Different delivery options may offer different benefits – so identify the options in discovery and explore further during alpha. Identify costs for discovery and alpha Consider the costs for: people software infrastructure team environment and facilities You’ll probably need to bring in additional skills at different points. You’ll also need: design and development tools a user research lab (possibly)  a large stock of whiteboards, sticky notes and pens Rate cards and price lists available in procurement frameworks can help you estimate costs. Evolve the service vision The service vision should state: what the service is and who it is for key benefits it provides how success will be measured  how it fits in with organisational strategy It may also contain known risks and constraints. Get approval Get department investment approval and Cabinet Office spend approval for discovery and alpha. There’s more information about this in the guidance on funding your digital service. Consider procurement needs Involve procurement and HR during discovery to ensure there is no lag between discovery and alpha. They’ll help you secure the resources and people needed. Make a decision to proceed or not Discovery has 4 possible outcomes – you can decide to: stop extend discovery (if you haven’t found out enough yet) restart discovery (if you need to investigate something completely different) proceed to alpha You should use the outputs from discovery to help you decide. You can make the decision to stop at any point during discovery. Set up your discovery team You’ll need a small team consisting of your stakeholders and any core team members that have been identified, including the service manager and potentially policy, procurement, HR and legal as required. Equip the discovery team properly Make sure people have a good working environment and the tools they need.

Any changes to the service should be based on emerging user needs and operating context (eg legislative or technological changes, espionage or criminal threats to the service). A service being continually improved is a condition of a service being on GOV.UK. Review your governance arrangements You should review what governance arrangements you’ll need for the live service, bearing in mind this covers both running the live service and improving the service. Plan for known risks By the time you’re running a live service, most of your delivery risks will have been dealt with in earlier phases. However, it’s important to understand what risks can affect the success of your service and the benefits it’s expected to deliver. Continue to work in an agile way You should continue to run show and tells to provide opportunities to demonstrate new and changed features. The team may ask for help in unblocking something or a decision on something that needs your steer. Retrospectives still provide valuable opportunities for reflection, learning and improvement in live operation. They might focus on the service operation in the broadest sense or specific activities like introducing new or improved features. If you have more than one service, you could look at ways of having larger retrospectives where the services share how they are working, what’s working well for them and what isn’t. Review benefits You should now be getting the benefits you expected. You’ll have a service dashboard on the performance platform which will show actual take-up of the digital service. You can compare its figures against those you predicted in the business case and find out if you are on track or not. You should also be: reviewing actual cost savings (eg less support calls, reduced administrative time spent on processing transactions) and deciding when to realise these by scaling back operations checking your assumptions about assisted digital and finding out whether its users are the expected demographic decommissioning obsolete systems Funding and approvals The business case for the service should cover development plus the first 2 years of live operation, including continuous iterative improvement.  Beyond this, you need to consider the budget demands for the live service as part of the department’s usual budgetary process. The funding should cover ongoing improvement and any minor changes needed to remain compliant with legislation. If the service needs a major overhaul, you should treat this as a new service development and start again with discovery. Revisit procurement needs Identify any external resource needs for live operation and ensure that investment and spend control approvals are secured to enable procurement activity to progress. The Government Digital Strategy aims to build in-house capability, so the need to procure external capability should reduce over time. Assurance and audit Part of assurance is reviewing whether or not expected benefits are being realised. You can use your department’s internal audit team to run reviews and the Major Projects Authority (MPA) will assure major projects. The National Audit Office audits most public-sector bodies in the UK and produces value for money reports into the implementation of government policies, so you may find that it does this for your service. Revisit the size and shape of the team During live service operation your team may need to change size and shape in response to user needs and operating context. Teams will expand and contract over the service lifetime. Find out more about live team requirements Ensure the team has skills necessary to run the live service It’s important the live service continues to improve. If you need to introduce new team members, you should manage this sensitively and gradually, in a way that allows them to gain confidence that they have the skills to continue development of the service. Review the team environment As your team changes it’s important to revisit their needs.

The term ‘guerrilla’ refers to its ‘out in the wild’ style, in the fact that it can be conducted anywhere eg cafe, library, train station etc, essentially anywhere where there is significant footfall. Guerrilla testing works well to quickly validate how effective a design is on its intended audience, whether certain functionality works in the way it is supposed to, or even establishing whether a brand or proposition is clear. This approach is quick and relatively easy to set up. Participants are not recruited but are ‘approached’ by those persons conducting the sessions. The sessions themselves are short, typically between 15-30 minutes and are loosely structured around specific key research objectives. The output is typically ‘qualitative’ so insight is often rich and detailed. Anyone on the service team can conduct ‘guerrilla testing’ on their site or service but often the best scenario is for a researcher to run the sessions with the designer or developer. The researcher can help with defining the tasks, moderating the sessions as well as provide a level of ‘objectivity’ by not being the person who designed or built what is being evaluated. Involving the designer / developer in the sessions enables them to see first hand ‘real’ people interacting with their product, where there are areas for improvement and how they might go about resolving any issues. This approach also does away with any lengthy reporting back. Insights can be observed, taken away and fed back into the design process almost immediately. However, a brief summary with key findings and recommendations can be written up as a more formal record. It is a method that suits the ‘agile framework’ well. Guerrilla testing can be used throughout the service lifecycle. As it is cheap to set up, run and report back on, it is a method that can be used frequently. There are a few logistics that should be taken into consideration before conducting any guerrilla testing; Remember, whenever recording sessions you must seek permission from the participant first. Provide them with a written consent form for them to sign. The key weakness of guerrilla testing as a research method it that is not statistically robust and participants may not always match your ‘target’ audience in terms of skills, expertise, knowledge. This can vary from between 6-12 participants in any given round of guerrilla testing. It is very much dependent on where and when those sessions are conducted. 16 teenagers evaluated the National Citizen Service website. Sessions were conducted in the canteen of a further education college in Nottingham. Usability and editorial findings were discovered and quickly fed back to the development teams. The whole process took 2 days.","description":"Guerrilla user testing is a low cost method of user testing.

If you don’t have access to staff with these skills, you may have to work closely with other groups who do in a consultancy capacity. This may include the team at GDS, or outside specialists.

Also take into account the contact methods you intend to support, such as: To help with your planning, make sure each of these channels has a separate volume forecast. These forecasts will either inform, or help to make, decisions on what technology you’ll use to route, handle, and store the historical data of these enquiries. Work out the average handling time (AHT) and variance for each type of enquiry. If you’re building AHT with deep historical data, you may be able to model the AHT separately for each kind of enquiry. Use the best historical data available to calculate the average number of enquiries per day a single agent can handle when dealing with a representative mix of enquiries types. Work out the expected level of service that should be maintained by your helpdesk. Generally, service level (SL or SLA) is worked out as x per cent of enquiries resolved in y time units. For example, you might plan to answer 80% of your incoming email enquiries in 24 hours. You need to know the desired service level so you can work out how many agents you’ll need for your helpdesk. If your staffing is constrained by other factors, use this value as a constant and aim for the best service level that can be achieved at a certain volume level. You can only finalise your overall demand forecast and work out staff numbers when you have finished planning for: The same historical data you used to create your enquiry forecast will likely give you an idea of how the enquiries will be received throughout the planning period (likely a week).

Why do we do this? There are service providers on GCloud who will provide DNS Hosting with a web-interface for you to manage your DNS records. Many infrastructure hosting providers also provide DNS services for the use of their customers. As a last resort (or for larger services) you may wish to ask the supplier to provide DNS services by any means they consider reasonable (including utilising options 1 and 2 above). Once a domain name for a service has been agreed, the GDS Infrastructure Team allocates service.gov.uk domain names by delegating control to the team running the service. The team should provide the details of nameservers and GDS will delegate {service-name}.service.gov.uk to those nameservers. At that point the service team will be able to manage the detailed configuration of which servers the domain name points to, and so on. The domain direct.gov.uk was managed by the DirectGov Service Desk directly (and inherited by GDS). All domains were administered by DirectGov and each subdomain did not have its own DNS servers. This meant that services would need to give details of the names and IP addresses of their webservers to DirectGov, who would directly create the necessary A and CNAME records. The DirectGov Service Desk were also a critical part of any DNS change. The new model for service.gov.uk domains requires that you provide your own DNS servers which can respond to requests for {something}.{servicename}.service.gov.uk. It is not necessary that you run and manage your own separate DNS servers: It is likely that as you build and iterate your service you will need to make a number of changes to its configuration. You might introduce load balancers or content delivery networks, you may move hosting providers, or your provider might need to change the IP addresses that your servers are assigned. In any of those cases it is important that your team is able to quickly respond to the situation and make any relevant changes with as few intermediaries as possible. By delegating control GDS ensures that control is in the hands of the service team and not blocked by a central authority.","description":"Once a domain name for a service has been agreed, the\nGDS Infrastructure Team allocates service.gov.uk domain names by delegating control to the team running\nthe service.

This is an explanation of some of our guidance and the reasons behind the rules. Users only really read 20 to 28% of a web page. Where users just want to complete a service as quickly as possible, there’s added user impatience so you may find users skim words even more. The content design guidance, style guide and design patterns give guidance on how to write. This page details why we do it. All of this guidance is based on the learning skills of an average person in the UK, who has English as a first language. You don’t read one word at a time. You bounce around. You anticipate words and fill them in. By the time you’re 9 years old, your brain can drop up to 30% of the text and still understand. Your vocabulary will grow but this reading skill stays with you as an adult. You should also be confident in sounding out words and blending sounds. You may not know the word, but you have the skills to be able to learn it. This is why we talk about the reading age being around 9 years old. When you learn to read, you start with a mix of upper and lower case but you don’t start understanding upper case until you’re around 6 years old. At first, you may sound out letters, merge sounds, merge letters, learn the word. Then you stop reading it. At that point, you recognise the shape of the word. This speeds up comprehension and speed of reading. So we don’t want people to read. We want people to recognise the ‘shape’ of the word and understand. It’s a lot faster. Capital letters are reputed to be 13 to 18% harder for users to read. So we try to avoid them. Also, in modern usage it sounds like we’re shouting. We are government. We should not be shouting. By the time you are 9, you’re building up your ‘common words’. Your primary set is around 5,000 words in your vocabulary; your secondary set is around 10,000 words. These are words you use every day. They include a lot of plain English words, which is why we should be obsessed with them. These are words so easy to comprehend, you learn to read them quickly and then you stop reading and start recognising. We explain all unusual terms on GOV.UK. This is because you can understand 6-letter words as easily as 2-letter words – if they’re in context. Sometimes, you can read a short word faster than a single letter – if the context is correct. Not only are we giving users full information, we’re speeding up their reading time. By giving full context and using common words, we’re allowing them to understand in the fastest possible way. In tools and transactions you need to give people context. By giving them information they’re expecting, you help them get through it faster. We should remember that people with some learning disabilities read letter for letter. They don’t bounce around like other users. They also can’t fully understand a sentence if it’s too long. People with moderate learning disabilities can understand sentences of 5 to 8 words without difficulty. By concentrating on common words we can help all users understand sentences of around 25 words. Our audience is potentially anyone living in the UK. We need to be able to communicate in a way that most users understand. Government can’t afford to be elitist and use language only specialists can understand. We need to open up our information and services to everyone. That means using common words and working with natural reading behaviour.

It’s made up of two things; Building good services means meeting the needs of users. 82% of the UK population is online. They have high expectations for what makes a good digital service, whether it’s from a bank, a travel agent, a retailer or a broadcaster, and when services don’t meet those standards they let the people responsible know. Government needs to learn from teams who are building successful, world class services. It needs to place users at the heart of service design, incorporating their feedback at every step of the way. Typically, government services are built after long, costly procurement processes.  In this way of working, users are seldom – if ever – consulted about the service they’ll be using. The first time the public might see a service is when it goes live, by which time it’s too late to make any changes when it turns out to be unfit for purpose. This way of working tends to encourage the creation of overly prescriptive policy, which then forms the basis of the requirements document. Instead, teams need to constantly iterate against user feedback.  This means building and testing in small chunks, working quickly to deliver improvements to a service. Teams will work out how to best meet the needs of users, releasing code regularly and working in an agile way. This new approach allows closer working between policy and delivery teams and as a result, the development of more responsive policy, two aims of the Civil Service Reform plan. The GDS Design Principles present a clear vision of how delivery teams can think about designing digital by default services. These should be a touchstone for every member of a delivery team. The Government Digital Strategy sets out the context we are working in. The departmental responses to the strategy contain a detailed breakdown of which services in particular will be tackled first. The progress of the services is also published on GOV.UK. And the Digital by Default Service Standard lists the criteria against which all new and redesigned services will be judged from April 2014. Find out which services must meet the standard. Another good way of finding out what’s going on in the government around digital is through the SPRINT initiative, organised by the Cabinet Office. At SPRINT13, Minister for the Cabinet Office Francis Maude discussed the current landscape of digital within government. Watch that video below. SPRINT 13 also saw a talk by Stephen Kelly in which he paints a picture of what service redesign could mean for users. When you’re confident about the basics of service design and the requirement of the standard, you can start exploring the advice and guidance in the manual. You can explore the manual by phase of delivery, specific roles, or by topic.","description":"The service manual is here to help service managers and digital delivery teams across government make services so good that people prefer to use them.

It’s essential reading for those transforming technology provision across government, describing the challenges and opportunities of this new approach. The technology code of practice describes the criteria that requests for spending approval will be judged against. It describes a vision of technology provision which can meet and adapt to the changing needs of users throughout government. The spending controls process ensures that spending on technology and digital services meets the needs of users and provides good value for money. There must be a level playing field for open source and proprietary software solution, that allows organisations the flexibility to change technologies and innovate based on data.

Information security is a topic both broad and deep, drawing from fields ranging from economics and psychology through to mathematics and probability. This document doesn’t provide a thorough review of the field. Instead, it aims to: The term information security refers to the theory and practice of defending data or information systems against: There are 3 main concepts that security professionals frequently refer to: In government, much is made of these 3 main “concepts of information security,” as will be explained below. Security systems typically attempt to address one or more of these concerns through: Not every system requires a full range of security controls. ’Completely secure systems’ don’t exist, and overly secure systems are often too expensive or thoroughly inconvenient for their users. Aim to build a service that is appropriately secure, which you can achieve by managing risks. In practice, you’ll be guided by an assessment of the risks related to a lapse in the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of your service. The Government Security Classifications Scheme divides information assets into three tiers: The vast majority of HMG information assets will be classified as OFFICIAL, including personal and sensitive personal citizen data as defined by the Data Protection Act. Security at OFFICIAL is achieved through following good commercial practices, using well configured commodity technologies and by people taking personal responsibility and using their judgement more actively. The Securing Technology at OFFICIAL collection is a valuable resource for understanding how OFFICIAL information should be protected. Assurance is the broad set of activities involved in assessing and managing the risks associated with a system under development. If your assurance processes work correctly: The important thing to note about building trustworthy and secure systems is that it’s a team game. Involve some level of assurance in your project, no matter how small. This may be as simple as documenting the limited risks. Don’t make assurance a completely separate strand of work, or see it as a hurdle to be jumped over (or sidestepped). You’ll only end up with the best product by dealing with risk and making decisions based on a range of expert opinion. It’s also important not to see assurance as a one-off activity, or as a milestone to be achieved and then forgotten about. As with every other element of your service, you should constantly review and iterate your information security practices. When designing or operating a service, you’re responsible for making sure that the service, as a whole, provides appropriate security for the information you receive, process and store. Whether you’re buying a commodity service such as hosting as a component of your service or designing a service from scratch, the Cloud Security Principles are a useful way of thinking about different elements of your service’s security. These principles are designed as a common way for suppliers to explain how their services manage information security. They also provide an excellent framework for thinking about how your service should manage information security. Not all of these principles will be applicable to every service but they’re a good starting point. The Cloud Security Guidance collection contains more information on how these principles work and how security can be implemented against each principle. The following content will introduce you to assurance in government and will use quite a lot of acronyms. Unfortunately these are in common usage and it’s very hard to work with the existing documentation and processes without speaking the lingo. It’s included here in the hope that they’ll provide a helpful reference that can be used when reading existing documentation. It’s important to understand the different roles involved with the assurance process. Each role requires formal training and specialist skills, so decide who plays each of these roles from the very beginning: A SIRO will generally be a senior member of the lead organisation that’s providing the service and is responsible for: More hands on than the SIRO, the accreditor or accreditors will work with the project team to help with: The IAO will be a senior individual involved in running the relevant business. Their role is to understand what information is held, what is added and what is removed, how information is moved, and who has access and why. As a result they are able to understand and address risks to the information. CESG are the government agency responsible for Information Security. They can provide technical assistance or consultation on project issues. The IT Health Check (ITHC) forms part of the assurance process. In essence it’s a penetration test carried out by a CESG approved supplier (specifically a CHECK certified individual). Read guidance on penetration and vulnerability testing for more details. Assurance work is not just about getting a project to launch, but also covers the running of the resulting service. Over time, new threats may emerge, systems and processes may change, and assumptions may become invalid. Keep your documentation up to date and carry out additional penetration tests on a regular or as-needed basis. It’s important to understand that the assurance processes and tools are all about managing the risk associated with the running service. Security is part of this, but just one part. Nearly everything will contain risks: Understand those risks and put in place sensible and suitable mitigations. It’s unrealistic in most cases to aim for a system with no risks, and ignoring them is a recipe for future failure. Aim for a system where the risks are known, and have your team work with risk professionals to make careful decisions about how to deal with them.","description":"When building your service, you’ll need to make sure that appropriate steps are\ntaken to guarantee its security.","link":"/service-manual/making-software/information-security.html"},{"_type":"manual_section","organisations":["government-digital-service"],"manual":"/service-manual","title":"Government Service Design Manual: Job descriptions","indexable_content":"Templates Senior Civil Servant (SCS) roles Non-SCS specialist roles information about the department and its objectives information about the role and current priorities / activities in digital and technology location recruitment process details and contacts information on reporting lines GIS declaration and Immigration Status Forms Chief Digital Officer (CDO) Download as OpenDocument Format / Download as MS Word doc Chief Technology Officer (CTO) Download as OpenDocument Format / Download as MS Word doc Head of Business IT Download as OpenDocument Format / Download as MS Word doc Head of Policy and Performance Download as OpenDocument Format / Download as MS Word doc Service Manager Download as OpenDocument Format / Download as MS Word doc Technology Lead Download as OpenDocument Format / Download as MS Word doc Agile Coach (this is not a permanent role) Download as OpenDocument Format / Download as MS Word doc Business analyst Download as OpenDocument Format / Download as MS Word doc Content designer Download as OpenDocument Format / Download as MS Word doc Delivery manager Download as OpenDocument Format / Download as MS Word doc Designer Download as OpenDocument Format / Download as MS Word doc Developer Download as OpenDocument Format / Download as MS Word doc Digital Communications Lead Download as OpenDocument Format / Download as MS Word doc Junior visual designer Download as OpenDocument Format / Download as MS Word doc Performance analyst Download as OpenDocument Format / Download as MS Word doc Portfolio manager Download as OpenDocument Format / Download as MS Word doc Product manager Download as OpenDocument Format / Download as MS Word doc Programme Delivery Manager Download as OpenDocument Format / Download as MS Word doc Technical Architect Download as OpenDocument Format / Download as MS Word doc User researcher Download as OpenDocument Format / Download as MS Word doc Web ops Download as OpenDocument Format / Download as MS Word doc Many of the skills now needed in government – both from the leaders of digital and technology teams and the teams themselves – are ones that have rarely been looked for in the past.

These job descriptions assume that organisational design guidance set out in the manual has broadly been followed. For advice on tailoring these designs to your organisation, contact GDS via the Recruitment Hub. The templates have left gaps for departments to complete. Recruiters will need to add: Before advertising any SCS technology position, the Recruitment Hub must have reviewed and agreed the job description after it has been tailored to a specific organisation and post.

From a traditional perspective, user testing measures how well participants respond in the key areas of: This approach is combined with more ‘qualitative’ techniques to help understand the users’ motivations and attitudes as well. A product or service is usually assessed by asking small samples of the target audience to complete specific but realistic tasks in one to one sessions. The facilitator observes how well the participants are able to complete those tasks, noting down the areas or features that cause the participant problems. Often the facilitator will ask participants to think aloud whilst completing those tasks in order to understand their decision processes better. User testing can be conducted on low-fi assets (eg paper prototypes, wireframes) and hi-fi assets, including working prototypes and live digital services. It’s most effective when conducted early within the lifecycle of a product but can be conducted towards the end of the service lifecycle to validate any usability improvements. A lab environment can provide a more formal setting for conducting sessions, with most spaces offering viewing facilities enabling stakeholders and key team members to watch the sessions in real time. Usability testing is best suited to finding the big issues, essentially the problems that affect users trying to perform tasks. However, it is qualitative in nature and is not statistically robust due to the small participant numbers, per round. The lab environment may also be considered a weakness. It means testing is conducted in a very different space to that a user will commonly be in. This method is not an appropriate for understanding user behaviour or user needs eg what they might want from a product or service. Between 5-8 participants, per round of user testing is sufficient to highlight the majority of usability issues. The key is to test often.","description":"User testing is a ‘qualitative’ research method, used to gauge how easy and intuitive a (product, service, website) is to use and whether it supports the needs of its intended audience.","link":"/service-manual/user-centred-design/user-research/lab-based-user-testing.html"},{"_type":"manual_section","organisations":["government-digital-service"],"manual":"/service-manual","title":"Government Service Design Manual: User accounts and logins","indexable_content":"Find alternatives When there isn’t an alternative Credentials Lower usage rates Also see significantly increasing your user support overhead (people forget how to sign in, lose their passwords etc) gathering personal data that you’ll need to constantly review and protect adding a relatively complex interaction for users to complete provide a tool to help send the URL to an email address have instructions on creating a bookmark in their browser take their email address and let them know if the search results change who you’re providing a login service for – a small number of agents (administrative users, accredited partners etc) or for a broad range of citizens or businesses? if you have enough user data – enough to build trust with users or will you need to match them against other services (online or offline)? specifically monitor use of the system for attempts to gain access, like            unusually high numbers of failed login attempts over a short period of time       a sequence of failed logins on a given account over a long period of time         unusually high numbers of failed login attempts over a short period of time a sequence of failed logins on a given account over a long period of time separate user data from other data you hold to avoid collecting a large amount of identifiable information swap to a new identity system, like the GOV.UK Verify scheme, without invasive changes to the rest of your codebase build a system for a broad range of citizens and businesses do sophisticated matching with other systems so you can build confidence in the identity of your users Wikipedia on password policies CESG Good Practice Guide 44: authentication credentials in support of HMG online services xkcd cartoon explaining password vs. passphrase    For some admin systems on GOV.UK we use the   zxcvbn   library that measures how hard it would be for a computer to crack a   passphrase using brute-force methods.

GDS advise that teams do not build login systems. Building a login system is no easy task. While there are numerous open source libraries that make it trivial to add login functionality to your service, the moment you add that feature you’re: Many features that often come with using a login system can be completed in other (and potentially more useful) ways. Saving search results, for example, doesn’t require a login but just a way of helping users remember a specific URL. Instead of having users log in, you could: The exact details will vary according to what users need from your service, but if there’s an alternative to a login system – use it. If, after careful review and design work, there’s no option but to build a login system, you’ll need to consider: It’s probably safe to carry on if you’re building a service for a small number of clearly identified agents. Make sure that any authentication and authorisation code written for your system is carefully separated from the application so that you can: Read the advice published by the GOV.UK Verify if you need to: You should help your users to pick strong, secure passwords or phrases and consider whether it’s appropriate to require 2-factor authentication for extra security. As a minimum passphrases should be eight characters long and include a mix of letters, numbers and symbols, but ideally they’ll be longer than that. We refer to passphrases as a phrase is usually easier to remember but harder to guess than a short collection of symbols or a single word.

That library is used to validate   new passphrases and insist on strong passphrases. It’s only one measure,   but it increases our confidence that our users are picking good   passphrases. All new government services should be served over HTTPS to ensure the communication between the user and the service is encrypted. This is especially important when logging in. The Electronic License Management System (ELMS) license application system on Business Link required a login to complete an application. In building a new version of the system for GOV.UK we removed that requirement and usage rates have increased considerably.

Your ability to act quickly and constructively on user feedback depends on how well you can arrange enquiries for analysis. How you choose to put enquiries into relevant subgroups will depend on: These factors will decide if the process of arranging enquiries will be carried out manually (staff create the metadata for the enquiries they handle) or be automated (the software you use for handling enquiries will add most of the metadata automatically). At the very least, arrange enquiries by: In addition to the very basic channel and target arrangements mentioned above, the following categories may be suitable. Is the enquiry a: Given user privacy concerns, spend time thinking about how you’ll collect data on your users. At the very least, gather minimal information on who is requesting assistance.

Is an enquiry open, pending some other action, solved etc Some internal sectional or functional categories along which you’ll want to be able to stratify–think of separate URLs or sections on a large website as a concrete example. Capture information on the different aspects of the handling processes. You’ll want to have information on: The ultimate reason for contacting helpdesk, eg: As with most of these, tailor these categories based on the specifics of your product and support model. Now that you’ve gathered your data, you need to decide how to share it. Sharing data is easier if all the data can be handled and used directly within your organisation. However, it’s likely that different teams will act on different types of problems, and some may be outside of your department. If possible through your system, use automation for sharing data. Treating each enquiry from a user as being due to a defect in the service itself is a very ambitious improvement model. Here enquiries are either seen as a fault in your support model for your service, or in the communications processes you use to handle enquiries. While this can exaggerate the reason for some kinds of contact (is a user’s email of thanks and appreciation genuinely a defect?) it’s an excellent way to direct critical thinking on how you provide service. Once the enquiry-level improvement data has been sent to the right group, begin doing analysis for improving processes. Join your enquiry level data with cost data to help prioritise which areas to target first. But you can also simply use the number (or percentage) of affected users as a tool for prioritising. In any case, make sure you have access to staff with experience in process analysis and improvement, ideally with relevant contact centre or technology experience. Directly involving the individuals who handle enquiries and those who built the service into improvement projects will produce better and faster results.","description":"Now you’ve created a helpdesk, it’s time to figure out how to make the best use of user feedback so you can improve your service and your user experience.","link":"/service-manual/operations/managing-user-support.html"},{"_type":"manual_section","organisations":["government-digital-service"],"manual":"/service-manual","title":"Government Service Design Manual: A/B and multivariate experiments","indexable_content":"Further reading This article in Wired shows how A/B experiments were used to good effect in Obama’s election campaign.

Depending on your audience you’ll be able to extract the parts of the name and do stuff with them. As soon as you adopt multiple fields you introduce the possibility that: If you need to use multiple name fields then the preferred labelling is ‘First name’, ‘Last name’.  Don’t include ‘Middle names’ unless you absolutely have to and make sure it’s optional (you don’t need to mark it as optional as users will understand this). We recommend against asking for people’s title.  It’s extra work for users and you’re forcing them to potentially reveal their gender and marital status,  which they may not want to do. There are appropriate ways of addressing people in correspondence without using titles. If you have to implement a title field, make it an optional free-text field, not a drop-down list. Predicting the range of titles your users will have is impossible, and you’ll always end up upsetting someone.  Remember to deal with the name data sensibly in any resulting correspondence. Users of GOV.UK services come from many different cultural backgrounds, each with their own conventions regarding personal names.

There’s also data on how people use these services and who those people are. Data about service performance allows service managers to see how well a service is running. It also means that users can hold us to account. Data about service performance should therefore be public data. You should publish all public data, unless it is private data collected from people or restricted for national security reasons. Public data is anonymised data: If for some reason you have made a procurement choice that means your performance data is monitored or stored by a third party, you should make sure that you have the right to access, export, share and reuse that data openly and in an open format. Your department has its own Open Data Strategy (for 2012-2014) and will already be publishing data sets on data.gov.uk. Your commitment to open, public data doesn’t stop there. Your open data should be user-friendly and findable. You should support people who want to reuse it and provide guarantees about how it will be made available. Publishing on data.gov.uk makes your data findable and will tell you how it ranks on a 5-star rating scheme to indicate whether the data and the format that it is published in is open. You should aim to reach at least the 3-star standard. The Open Data Certificates from the Open Data Institute measure how usable the data is for people who want to reuse it, and help identify ways in which you can improve how you publish the data. You should get a certificate for your data. The Open Data Principles that you must follow are: Users are already using your services, giving you lots of data about their behaviour. This means you can learn from real world behaviour when you’re designing a new digital service. You can watch and learn from your users, shaping the system to fit what people naturally choose to do. Recognise that you can’t do it all. In making your data open, you are encouraging greater use of the data and helping users to innovate. Developers need to be able to use the data, to share it, and combine it with other data to use in their own applications, for example through application programming interfaces (APIs). As with all government digital services you’ll need to understand the user need for the data you publish. You’ll need to keep developers aware of what datasets you are releasing and to maintain relationships with those primary data users at the cutting edge of technology who can help you to do things differently and in more agile ways. You can use the engagement areas of data.gov.uk to reach out and keep in touch with data users. You need to be scrupulous in protecting individual privacy by taking appropriate steps to ensure personal data is secure. You should consider privacy issues at the beginning of all discussions concerning the release of a new dataset or the building of or change to a digital service dealing with personal data. If you are using new technology to handle personal data or reusing the data in a different way, you may need to carry out a Privacy Impact Assessment. This is an important part of the process for identifying and managing risk. The Cabinet Office is preparing a new Code of Practice (Datasets) (the consultation on this draft version is now closed). This code includes the licensing framework you must use when making your datasets available for reuse. There are a number of licenses in the framework. For UK government open data, this will be the Open Government Licence. Your open data can give: Building your services on open formats and open standards means that you can more easily share, reuse or exchange data. It will also mean that you will have a choice in which technology to implement, rather than being limited to a particular product or supplier. You can browse the apps section of data.gov.uk to see hundreds of applications that have been built using open government data. You can also find case studies of how people are sharing, using and building open data on the data.gov.uk site. The team at data.gov.uk is a good first point of contact for help in understanding how to make your data open. You can get in touch with them through data.gov.uk. The Open Data Institute and the Open Knowledge Foundation can give you advice and training on how to open up your data. The Government Statistical Service has developed computer-based training to help you to make the right decisions about how to make data available in open formats.","description":"Data that is truly open is:","link":"/service-manual/technology/open-data.html"},{"_type":"manual_section","organisations":["government-digital-service"],"manual":"/service-manual","title":"Government Service Design Manual: Open programme","indexable_content":"Who should take part Supporting people to use your digital service Design and improve your digital service Practice, procurement and platforms for your digital service Request a place Design principles in action Always be testing Data-driven services Procurement, spend controls and governance Being agile Identity assured      learn about why it’s important to support people to use your service         develop your understanding of why people might not use your digital service and how to overcome barriers         walk personas through a user journey, to see where they might need support and what that could look like         discuss the requirements of the Digital by Default Service Standard for these areas, covering expectations at each development phase         share your experience with other service managers and work together to improve your understanding of effective support for digital services.         discover the 10 design principles and how they were created         hear from a product manager who has used them on a project         consider how they will be applied to your own services         keep your team concentrating on real user needs         help teams design products which are prioritised by user needs          help teams iterate products in response to user feedback         discuss your service’s performance indicators as they currently stand         consider what data you currently use to inform your decision-making, and what data you would like to use         design your own performance data dashboard to understand your services in a simple, visual way         find out about the Performance Platform and how you can use it         consider how to procure tools and systems fit for the purpose of agile, user-centred development         discuss the range of options available, and how to determine make or buy decisions         hear the latest on the government procurement processes and frameworks available on digital transformations         discuss the prevailing investment approvals and spend controls         agile artefacts, themes, epics and user stories         sprint planning and the use of walls to make shared priorities visible         retrospectives to continually inspect and improve the work teams do together         creating a market so that users can choose from a number of identity providers         setting standards for consistently meeting the needs of users, services and departments         building and running the hub that connects services to identity providers         working with departments and agencies to identify their services’ GOV.UK Verify requirements and plan their transition to using the GOV.UK Verify service    These 3 days contain specialist modules to help you succeed and improve in particular areas of the Digital by Default Service Standard. Unless already very familiar with digital in government, participants should complete either the specialist digital foundation day or the service manager induction before taking part in the open programme. All sessions will run at a central London location. The programme is funded centrally, but you or your department will need to pay for any accommodation, meals and subsistence expenses, in line with your departmental policies. This one day module will cover digital take-up, digital inclusion and assisted digital, and focuses on supporting your users to use your digital service. These are all areas required by the Digital by Default Service Standard. It’s essential to ‘shift’ people away from non-digital channels and increase the take-up of government digital services so more users can benefit from improved government services. Departments and agencies will also come under increasing pressure to deliver the return on the investment in digital services – estimated at between £1.7 and £1.8 billion per year. Digital inclusion helps people become capable of using and benefiting from the internet. This means that most users will be able to use new and redesigned government digital services unaided, but there are some who will need help through assisted digital support. You will: learn about why it’s important to support people to use your service develop your understanding of why people might not use your digital service and how to overcome barriers walk personas through a user journey, to see where they might need support and what that could look like discuss the requirements of the Digital by Default Service Standard for these areas, covering expectations at each development phase share your experience with other service managers and work together to improve your understanding of effective support for digital services. This one day module will cover the GOV.UK Design Principles, user research and data-driven services. These are all areas required by the Digital by Default Service Standard. A set of simple but powerful design principles underpin all the work done by GDS to develop the award-winning GOV.UK website. In this session your group will: discover the 10 design principles and how they were created hear from a product manager who has used them on a project consider how they will be applied to your own services Carry out user research in every stage of your project. Do it continuously through each stage – don’t leave it as something that happens at the beginning and end of phases. You will find out how doing user research continuously will: keep your team concentrating on real user needs help teams design products which are prioritised by user needs  help teams iterate products in response to user feedback Using data to inform decision-making is vital to the development of your services. Your group will: discuss your service’s performance indicators as they currently stand consider what data you currently use to inform your decision-making, and what data you would like to use design your own performance data dashboard to understand your services in a simple, visual way find out about the Performance Platform and how you can use it This one day module will cover governance, procurement and spend control in an agile context, along with an overview of the GOV.UK Verify platform. These are all areas required by the Digital by Default Service Standard. Delivering high quality digital services that can be improved continuously requires investment in the right capabilities. As a group you will: consider how to procure tools and systems fit for the purpose of agile, user-centred development discuss the range of options available, and how to determine make or buy decisions hear the latest on the government procurement processes and frameworks available on digital transformations discuss the prevailing investment approvals and spend controls … all in the context of governance that helps to direct, steer, monitor but above all else, enable service delivery.

Completed challenges – go here on the Standards Hub to find out which standards profiles are compulsory for use in government. Open Standards Principles Open Standards: Open Opportunities consultation outcome This information is to be used as guidance on using open standards and why they matter, and should not be taken as legal advice. GDS define open standards for software interoperability, data, and document formats as those that meet all of these criteria: The standard is maintained by working together in a decision-making process that is consensus-based and independent of any individual supplier. Involvement in the development and maintenance of the standard is accessible to all interested parties. The decision-making process is transparent and a review is carried out by subject matter experts, which is open to the public. To guarantee quality, the standard is taken on by a specification or standardisation organisation, or a forum or consortium with a feedback and approval process. The standard is published, thoroughly documented, and publicly available at zero or low cost. Other than creating innovative solutions, the standard is supported by the market and displays platform, application and vendor independence. Rights are essential to the implementation of the standard, and for communicating with other implementations using that same standard. They’re licensed on a royalty-free basis that’s compatible with both open source and proprietary licensed solutions. These rights should be irrevocable unless there is a breach of licence conditions. There are 7 open standards principles to follow when thinking about which open standards to use: GDS describe the reasons for these principles and their implications in ‘Open Standards Principles’, published in November 2012. The Open Standards Board will be selecting some compulsory open standards using the Standards Hub process. Use standards that have been identified. There might be instances where you’re looking for an open standard and GDS have not set a compulsory one in that space. If so, do a thorough assessment of existing standards and choose one that meets your needs and is consistent with GDS’s definitions. You should also consider how the standard fits with: You’ll need to apply for exemptions to open standards if: By implementing open standards for software interoperability, data and document formats, government is: Basing your build of component-based digital services on open standards will: Expressing your user needs in terms of required capabilities, which are in turn based on open standards, helps you to make better choices for service delivery.

Note: This does not apply to the set of interactive tools on GOV.UK known as ‘smart answers’ which are developed and maintained by GDS in partnership with other government departments.  Government offers a number of different digital services to citizens. While the start and end of a user’s journey will be on GOV.UK, the service itself will typically be hosted elsewhere, and will need a different domain name as a result. This page describes the use of service.gov.uk subdomains for hosting digital services. Note: This document is written as a ‘standard’, and as such uses the words MUST, SHOULD, MAY and MUST NOT as defined in RFC 2119. Every digital service offered by the UK government MUST have a single, well-known place on the internet where users can go to when they want to use the service. That well-known place will be the relevant start page on GOV.UK – for instance, the DVLA’s vehicle tax service is at https://www.gov.uk/vehicle-tax. Service managers MUST NOT advertise any URL other than that of the GOV.UK start page as the starting point for the relevant service. This is what gets printed in literature and used in email signatures, TV adverts etc. The start page URL for a given service will be allocated by GDS based on discussions with the service manager and analysis of user behaviour, search referrals and other relevant data. The transactional part of a service – the dynamically generated pages where users interact with the service – will typically not be hosted on the www.gov.uk domain. That means that each service needs its own domain name for the transactional part of the service. Note: This does not apply to the set of interactive tools on GOV.UK known as ‘smart answers’ which are developed and maintained by GDS in partnership with other government departments. For all new digital government services GDS will create a domain name of the form servicename.service.gov.uk (where “servicename” is a plain English description of the service agreed between the relevant dept/agency and the Government Digital Service). This will introduce consistency across central government domains for digital services and remove the dependency on departmental subdomains (which are of course vulnerable to machinery of government changes) and the now-retired DirectGov and BusinessLink online brands. The process of obtaining a service.gov.uk subdomain begins when the service manager emails gdsapprovals@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk.  Subdomains of service.gov.uk SHOULD describe the service (eg lastingpowerofattorney.service.gov.uk) and should not contain the name of the service owning department or agency (eg ministryofmagicwandregistration.service.gov.uk) The service-owning dept/agency will be given delegated authority to manage the domain and its subdomains, although in some cases this work will be carried out by third party suppliers. This section gives some guidance about which subdomains a service manager should create once they have been given control of servicename.service.gov.uk. Maximum number of visible subdomains The user-facing live service SHOULD be operated using at most three user-visible subdomains of servicename.service.gov.uk: You SHOULD NOT create separate domains for application programming interfaces (APIs) unless there’s a really good reason to have a completely separate domain. (Really good reasons are few and far between.) Service managers should notify the Government Digital Service technical architects (via your transformation team contact) if you intend to create user-visible subdomains other than the three listed above. We’re developing some patterns for more unusual system designs as well as for mainstream transactional services, and we’re always up for a discussion about exceptions and edge cases. Usernames and passwords If the service is a private alpha or private beta release then it should be protected by a username and password known only to the development team and the users who are testing the service. If a service, or part of a service, is a public alpha or beta releases then it should be clearly marked as such with a text label on every page (ie don’t use an image containing the word alpha or beta) and in every API response. Multiple environments It is good practice to have multiple ‘environments’ for the development, testing and live (aka production) versions of any service. The development and testing environments allow the team to assess the correctness and quality of the service before it goes live. Typically, the subdomains used to access a development or testing instance of the service are structured in the same way as the subdomains used in the live version of the service. Therefore, you MAY create other subdomains of servicename.service.gov.uk for use in testing and development, such as www-preview. and www-dev, or www.preview. and www.dev.. If there’s a compelling reason to use a non .gov.uk domain for testing and/or development subdomains, that’s also acceptable. Regardless of the domain name used, web-based services on testing and development domains (including APIs) should be protected by a username and password along the same lines as private alpha and beta releases. Many services will collect personal information from users. It’s very important that this information can’t be intercepted by malicious third parties as it travels over the internet. Therefore, all services accessed through service.gov.uk domains (including APIs) MUST only be accessible through secure connections. For web-based services this means HTTPS only (often referred to by the acronyms TLS or SSL, which both refer to the protocol underpinning these secure connections). Services must not accept HTTP connections under any circumstances. Once a service manager has verified that their HTTPS setup is working fine they SHOULD enable HSTS on the production domains (www., admin. and assets.), by setting an HTTP response header such as representing a commitment to HTTPS-only traffic for 14 days. Once the service manager is confident that HSTS is configured correctly, they SHOULD increase the commitment to months or years: Cookies used on www.servicename.service.gov.uk and admin.servicename.service.gov.uk MUST be scoped to the originating domain only. Cookies MUST NOT be scoped to the domain servicename.service.gov.uk. Cookies SHOULD NOT be used on assets.servicename.service.gov.uk (they introduce a browser overhead that slows down the response time for users without providing any benefit for the service manager). Cookies MUST be sent with the Secure attribute and SHOULD, where appropriate, be sent with the HttpOnly attribute. These flags provide additional assurances about how cookies will be handled by browsers. GOV.UK is the place for users to find all government services, so it’s important to ensure that users always start on the relevant GOV.UK page, rather than a different or duplicate start page on www.servicename.service.gov.uk. As a result, services need to ask search engines not to index pages on their domains, so that the relevant GOV.UK page and the service domain don’t compete with each other in search engine results. This can be achieved by redirecting users to the relevant GOV.UK start page if they go directly to the service’s domain name, and by asking search engines not to index pages on the service’s domain name. Therefore, every service hosted on a service.gov.uk domain MUST: have a robots.txt file on the www, admin and assets subdomains asking search engines not to index any part of the site. Example content for robots.txt is given below, and more details can be found on The Web Robots Pages: have an HTTP 301 redirection from the top-level index page of the www and assets subdomains to the relevant start page on GOV.UK. (Note: this means that the service start page on GOV.UK SHOULD NOT link to the root of the www domain.) If you have contracted with CDN-based DDOS-protection suppliers then you should register these additional subdomains for use by your suppliers: Your suppliers will use these subdomains to address your www, admin and assets services. Detailed configuration advice for origin servers is outside of the scope of this document, but it’s important to ensure that these ‘origin domains’ only listen for traffic from trusted sources like: At present we advise against allowing DDOS protection suppliers to terminate SSL connections for transactional services carrying personal information, but this behaviour isn’t prohibited at present. Although SSL termination on the third party network would allow the supplier(s) to carry out additional analysis and potentially extra mitigations against certain types of attack, it would also give the supplier access to all the personal information being submitted to your service.  There are obvious downsides to allowing this level of access, especially if the supplier’s network and processes have not been accredited to the same level as the rest of the service. It’s a risk-based decision, but if in doubt we suggest a presumption against SSL termination on third party networks. Many suppliers offer IP forwarding DDOS protection, which does not have the same security issues as SSL termination, and is recommended in preference to SSL termination.  If your service requires transaction monitoring (which is not at all the same thing as DDOS protection) you should contact your CESG account manager for advice. Emails to users of your service SHOULD be sent from a human-monitored email address that originates from the domain servicename.service.gov.uk (and not the dept/agency or any other domain name). You SHOULD apply the Common Technology Services email blueprint on the sending domain, including implementing Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting and Conformance (DMARC). If your service should need to wind down for any reason, you MUST ensure continued useful service and information for users by: For services that have been live for less than 6 months, you MUST continue to do the above for the remainder of a year total. For services that have been live longer than that you MUST continue to do the above for a further 12 months or until the expiry of the current SSL certificate, whichever comes first. The GOV.UK start page will be amended to explain that the service is no longer running, and cease to provide a start button pointing at the defunct service.","description":"Government offers a number of different digital services to citizens.

Sometimes an application may require one or more ‘wet signatures’ to validate it, or print alternatives may be part of your assisted digital support. For the most part you can approach these as design challenges like any other – the Design Principles are a great way to start this work – but there are some specific things you’ll want to bear in mind. The most important thing to remember is that print forms should only be made when absolutely necessary. For example, the legislation governing Lasting Powers of Attorney (LPA) requires ‘wet signatures’ for the application to be valid. Until this legislation changes, a print form has to be part of the final service. Aim for as much of the transaction as possible to be completed online. Users should have to print as little as possible in order to complete an application, which means: In lots of cases, paper forms will exist for services being redesigned. The launch of the digital service gives you an opportunity to improve them. When doing so, don’t just base your designs on the existing forms. Look at what information you need to carry out the transaction and try to eliminate unnecessary steps.   Performance data should be available for the existing forms. This will tell you about the most common options people select and the kinds of mistakes they make. This will be useful information while you design the new forms. Links, smart answers, search boxes and drop downs are not available in print publications. If a transaction requires multiple forms you will need to make sure the design and layout helps users navigate them as easily as their online counterparts.  In the Lasting Power of Attorney application forms, this meant:   Your paper forms are a small but important part of a digital process. Typically you’ll be switching to paper forms to collect a signature. There are some ways you can make this transition easier: You should test your paper forms with real users. For complex forms, plan for 3 rounds of lab testing, making improvements to the form between each round. You’ll gain valuable insight by attending the user research in person. Get an introduction to user research and find out about all the different kinds of testing. Templates (based on the Lasting Power of Attorney application) created by teams across government will help you make easy-to-complete forms, but lots of the ‘heavy-lifting’ will be in making specialist terms and language accessible to the majority of users. Where specialist terms are unavoidable, or necessary, you’ll need people who understand how users read and how best to write for government services when working on the design. Skilled content designers and copywriters will make forms – whether online or in print – simpler and clearer, improving the completion rate and user satisfaction in the process. They complement the digital transaction and should be easy to process by staff supporting the digital service. Their performance also has an impact on the KPIs you gather for digital services. Contact us if you’re starting work on print forms. We can send you the LPA form pack to use as a template. (The redesigned LPA forms will be made public soon by the Ministry of Justice as part of a formal consultation.)

How often you want to do this will affect how you design and build applications, and will present a number of challenges that this guide hopes to address. As early as possible in your product’s development, think about how you release updates to a running application. This is because it affects how software is developed and tested, and how your product may be supported. Being able to release software on demand is important. Release cycles of 6 months or longer are dangerous. Not only do new features rarely see the light of day, but known problems will have to be fixed within a rigid release schedule. It’s important to make the distinction between: Your application should always be in a state where it could be released, meaning quick changes can be made when needed. As an example, changes to the software running GOV.UK are made on average 5 times per day. To be able to do this, you have to consider: Although you need tools (potentially including commercial tools) to help with rapid releases, don’t start your discussions around what tools should be used or procured! Start discussions based on the needs of the service and the product team. In some organisations, people fear releasing new applications or new versions of software. Lots of websites, especially large applications within large traditional organisations, don’t change very often. Many will have fixed release schedules which might mean 1 release every 6 months or so. This means bundling up lots of changes into a single release, which is bad in at least 2 ways: It could be weeks or months before an improvement is actually released for people to use, even though it only took a few days to finish. This complexity means there are lots of different ways the release can go wrong. The combination of complexity, risk, and the infrequent nature of releases make for a stressful event for all involved. No wonder most people don’t like release day! Releasing software comes with risks, so trying to minimise those risks is a good idea. GDS does this in a number of ways, and the benefit of this is that: As well as reducing risk, being able to release early and often also helps products improve quickly, as it removes barriers to quick experiments and rapid iteration. Finally, consider the following 2 measures of a system: A very traditional approach involves working to reduce the time between any failures happening, hopefully improving the quality of the overall system. But problems will always happen at some point! Using your efforts to reduce the time taken to fix problems can often be much more cost effective, as well as improving the overall system uptime.","description":"Constantly improving online services means releasing updates to the underlying software.

Each session usually includes tasks being given to see how users interact with the website/online service and are followed up with a series of questions about their perceptions and how easy it was to complete the tasks. As there is no moderator present, special software is used in order to record the user’s interactions with the website/online service. While traditional lab testing focuses of gathering rich and detailed information, remote usability testing aims to test with large numbers of users and produce statistically significant results. It is recommended that remote testing is not conducted in isolation, and face to face testing is also completed. Remote usability testing can be used to test both website content, and online services. Testing content normally involves people completing tasks based on the online content, while online services are normally tested by asking users to complete a task using the online tool or transaction (like claiming Jobseeker’s Allowance or applying for a driving licence). Success is measured on whether the user can complete the tasks or transaction. Benchmarks on new and existing products are gathered so that completion rates (and other success measures) be collected and performance monitored. The key advantage of remote usability testing are that it: Although remote usability provides testing with large numbers of people, findings can lack depth as they focus on what people do, and not why they have done it. When testing new products the tasks can seem artificial, and this is increased when testing is conducted with a panel of users, instead of real users on a live site. Remote usability testing should not be used in isolation and it is recommended that it is used in conjunction with face to face testing with real users. In order to test new products that are still in development it is necessary to engage an online panel in order to recruit participants. Existing products and services can be testing via the live website. It is recommended that 400 responses are collected so that results are robust.

Where standard remote usability testing focuses on large numbers, and providing statistically significant findings, this type of testing enables you to get rich, qualitative data from respondents that would normally only be possible by observing users in person. As there is no moderator present, each session is recorded via screen capture software, that records the whole session, including the user talking about what they are doing, why they are doing it, and how they feel about it etc. All interviews are conducted in one hour, with the video sessions, and the answers to the follow up questions made available immediately.

This process of collecting information from a sample is referred to as ‘sampling’ and enables researchers to understand the views, and needs of a user base, without interviewing the whole user population. Consideration needs to be given to how the sample is collected (who, how, where, when) and the size of the sample collected for each study. A large sample size can be more accurate and provide greater confidence in the data collected, however a large sample is not required for all research projects. The sample method chosen should consider the size and scale of the project, the sub-group analysis required, and balance the robustness of the approach that with the time, money, and resource available to ensure its fit for purpose. Sampling can be a complex process to understand, but on most occasions a sample of 400-500 will be sufficient for most in-house studies – again this is dependent on the level of subgroup analysis needed and also the penetration of the target group in the population. The greater the number of population groups that need to be analysed may increase the sample size needed, as typically for findings to be statistically valid a minimum of 100 in a subgroup is required. A larger overall sample of 1000+ is normally required if findings need to be nationally representative. This guide to sampling (PDF, 885kb) was written by the National Audit Office, and although it was first published in 2001, still provides a helpful introduction to sampling methodologies.","description":"When conducting quantitative research it is essential that all findings are statistically valid, so that there is confidence in the findings and inferences can be made from the sample to the population.","link":"/service-manual/user-centred-design/user-research/sampling-methodologies.html"},{"_type":"manual_section","organisations":["government-digital-service"],"manual":"/service-manual","title":"Government Service Design Manual: Sass repositories","indexable_content":"Categories of Sass mixins Responsive design Cross browser Further reading GOV.UK typography, colours and image assets Mixins for responsive designs Mixins for targeting old versions of Internet Explorer Mixins for cross browser CSS Sass is a language for creating stylesheets that lets us share blocks of code and techniques. GDS has created a repository called the GOV.UK Frontend Toolkit to simplify the creation of services with a consistent look and feel. The toolkit is available as a gem for easy inclusion in Ruby projects. The files in the gem can be categorised into four main parts: The first part is the bit that gives all GOV.UK projects a familiar look. There are a collection of pre-defined font sizes that we use on GOV.UK. There is a mixin for each one, for example heading-26. These also include a standard amount of whitespace around the text to help with vertical rhythm on the page, spacing things out nicely. The second is a way to develop sites that are able to respond to different sized displays. The third is an easy way of writing Internet Explorer specific CSS in our stylesheets without using hacks. The fourth is a way to keep browser specific styles out of our projects. We encapsulate new or non-standardised CSS into mixins. In this way we can easily update all the instances of a new CSS property without having to do a search and replace across all our projects. It is generally advised to write your markup with a mobile first attitude. That is, add desktop styles to an otherwise narrow screen stylesheet. In this way you only add styles for desktop and don’t reset desktop styles for a mobile device. There are two main types of cross browser CSS that we are concerned with. Firstly using different techniques to achieve a consistent effect and secondly using vendor prefixes to apply consistent behaviour for newer features. For example: @extend %contain-floats uses a cross-browser technique to ensure that the element wraps all the floated elements within it. It is not a property that normally exists in CSS but is something we often need to do and don’t want to use different techniques everywhere. It gives us consistency across our code. @include border-radius is designed to use the different border radius implementations (-moz-border-radius, -webkit-border-radius etc) to create consistent presentation across different browsers.

Government IT is more appropriately mapped into distinct areas with different user needs — some are public facing, and some are for internal use. These areas include: These 4 areas are in very different stages of development. Digital public services, for example, are being built by developers using very new technologies. In contrast, technology infrastructure such as data storage has evolved over the course of decades. Products which 5 or 10 years ago would have required detailed and expensive customisation are now commoditised (packaged as ‘pay-as-you-go’) – to the extent where they have virtually become utility services like gas or electricity (you can move between suppliers easily). By using technology based on commodity products and services government can benefit from economies of scale and much greater efficiency. Improvements to digital and technology leadership will create a new way of working in government, supporting teams across the civil service in producing digital public services and better department-specific IT (or mission IT), and ensuring these teams have the right technology to support them. For this to happen, government digital and technology leadership should be strongly represented at board level and be specifically responsible for enabling business change. In many cases digital services and department-specific IT should – for now – be managed as separate but strongly linked workstreams, with a common aim of ensuring transformation across the department. In all cases where departments run digital services, digital should be represented at the same or higher seniority level as technology. The new roles of the Chief Digital Officer (CDO) and Chief Technology Officer (CTO) are for strategic, transformative leadership. CDOs will concentrate on producing digital public services and the wider digital by default strategy. CTOs will concentrate on providing the department-specific IT that supports digital public services and internal users. CTOs will also be in charge of moving their departments to common technology services. Both CDOs and CTOs will need to work out which areas can be commoditised and which need customised services. Both roles need to be getting the most out of new technologies, and will need to structure their teams accordingly. Models, structures and strategies are irrelevant without the right people in the right roles. The best way to restructure senior technology roles will vary across departments according to how much involvement they have across the 4 areas of government technology. In some cases both the CDO and CTO will sit on the board; in other cases they might report into a board level Chief Operating Officer (COO), or only the CDO might be on the board.  Where digital public services rely on department-specific IT systems to support them, a service manager role should be in place, reporting into the CDO with accountability and decision-making authority for the end-to-end service. In all organisations, roles that manage existing contracts, retiring legacy systems, and providing infrastructure services should be subordinate to leadership roles. GDS will provide support by establishing common infrastructure services so senior leaders in departments can concentrate on providing department specific technology for their users. GDS has also established a Recruitment Hub – an advisory service provided to departments to help them recruit talented technology leaders and digital specialists. As part of the Recruitment Hub service, GDS has already begun to work with departments and agencies to help with organisation design. Contact digitaltalent@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk for more information. The CTO/CDO organisational model is not designed to provide a fixed structure for decades to come. It’s a model that reflects the current state of government technology with both large legacy estates and new digital services in development, and is designed to support the changes in technology use over the next 3 to 5 years. Over time the distinction between digital public services and department-specific IT will weaken. As legacy systems are retired and more technology is delivered through the cloud, it will make less sense to draw a separation between the two areas. It’s quite possible that in 5 years’ time both citizens and internal users will use the same digital services and technology. Organisation and governance structures – both within and across departments – will need to develop too. It will be part of the responsibility of senior digital and technology leaders to keep the effectiveness of these structures under review to ensure that they remain fit for purpose.","description":"Government has traditionally treated IT as a single entity with the same approach being used for very different types of service.

Accreditation of government systems is costly, time consuming, and doesn’t help secure them. 3. Open source software is more / less secure than proprietary code. 4. “Product X can’t be used because it isn’t accredited by CESG” 5. Restricted systems need to have bespoke security controls. 6. “I’m not a target for cyber attack!” 7. Impact Levels define security requirements. 8. “I’ve got lots of IL3 records, which aggregate to IL4, so I need to build a confidential back end system” Protecting information from valid threats to its confidentiality, integrity and availability is an enabler of digital services. Without such protection, digital services would be impossible or unsafe. Please note: this guide sets out the governing principles for developing efficiently secured digital services. It also busts some common myths around security. There is another guide about the practical process of security accreditation. Security must be applied intelligently. This means analysing the probable interest in official information from threat sources, establishing their capabilities and methods, and matching proportionate mitigations against these in a traceable manner. Other attempts at security run the risk of over-engineering security controls, or providing an illusion of security by not mitigating the actual risks. Technology alone is never capable of addressing security and privacy risks: there needs to be a risk model that spans technology, people (their behaviours and culture), and processes. Bad user experience arising from over-prescriptive use of technology can lead users to circumvent security controls by employing less secure unofficial IT solutions. Users who then retain the official IT systems suffer degraded productivity. The outcome is that security is not maintained and user experience is unpleasant. However, security and a good user experience do not need to be mutually exclusive. Modern, intelligently designed security can often be made largely transparent to the user, while also providing the enterprise with the confidence it needs that its information is suitably managed. Where some degradation of user experience is unavoidable, a risk management analysis must consider the negative impact of users avoiding unpleasant official IT and degraded productivity. Furthermore, a transparent understanding of the mapping between official information, threat sources and capabilities, through to the required mitigations, enables informed risk management when there is a change in environment or appetite for risk. The vast majority of government’s information will fall into the lowest ‘official tier’. This ‘official tier’ has been created on the basis of a ‘commercial threat model’. This means protection from the type of threats faced by a large company or bank, eg cyber criminals or hacktivists intent on stealing personal or financial information, or disrupting services. To defend against threats such as these, government will use only the very best security technology sourced from the commercial market, and there will be no need for any bespoke or government-only controls at this level. A small set of software will perform security enforcing functions, such as firewalling or encrypting data. Such products require assurance that they function as advertised, achieved through the CESG Commercial Product Assurance (CPA) scheme. This scheme is lightweight compared to previous schemes, reflecting the commercial grade risks for OFFICIAL information. It’s the intention of the Civil Service Reform Plan and the new Security Classification Policy that there’s greater emphasis on user responsibility, reducing expensive and overbearing technical controls. This requires proper training to assist users in handling sensitive information, and auditing to verify users are acting responsibly. Users should be trusted to carry out their roles and given the responsibility to do so securely. Audit and verification of user behaviour should be used to ensure policy compliance instead of preventative measures which add cost and degrade productivity. Such audit and verification should be implemented by services or network infrastructure, away from the end user device. Government should not invest in security controls to protect users from risks they can protect themselves from. Departments should, however, invest in security controls that help defend individual users against threats that they themselves cannot reasonably defend. For example, government should not invest in special technology to prevent civil servants working on sensitive information in an open busy public place; users should be able to judge, assess and use appropriate risk mitigation approaches by themselves. Likewise, civil servants should be able to exercise reasonable judgement about what information is sent to external recipients by email over the public internet. This will lead to reduced technical controls and their associated costs, while also optimising the usability and flexibility of the IT tools for the majority of responsible users. The new security policy provides for a simpler and more meaningful approach to denoting the value of information assets and threat model. Together with a set of common controls for OFFICIAL information, it enables a more consistent, standardised, reusable and interoperable approach to securing information assets in government. There should no longer be situations where information cannot be shared between bodies solely because their interpretation of the same security guidance has led to incompatible controls. The Cabinet Office Security Classification Policy provides guidance as to which information falls into the ‘official’ category. It’s important to start thinking about security from the very start of an IT procurement project, as bolting it on later invariably introduces additional cost and delays. In fact, getting appropriate security into your system needs to start with specifying security requirements correctly in the contract. When we don’t adequately articulate security requirements for design and ongoing maintenance of a system, our suppliers price for the level of contractual risk the ambiguity introduces. Specifying security requirements of the form “must be accreditable for IL3” must become a thing of the past. The risk appetite of departments varies and suppliers not used to working with government will struggle to find out what that means for the design and maintenance of their system – adding cost and risk to both parties. Instead, when writing IT contracts, departments should think about what they care about from an information assurance perspective and specify requirements that actually manage their concerns. As well as getting a solution that address the real business needs, this approach also allows industry to innovate to solve the security problem. It is often said that security is the reason something can’t be done. This is very rarely the case in practice – rather, security is being (mis)used as a handy excuse to not do something. Good information risk management practices allow organisations to understand the risks they are taking with their information assets, and work out the most effective ways to manage and control those risks – while not hindering business. If someone tells you that “Security says No”, or that “CESG say No”, you should ask for more information to learn what the risks actually are, and what techniques and tools are available to help manage those risks. Accreditation effort should always be proportional to the complexity, threat and impact of a system. It is vital that the effort spent should scale to match the challenge at hand. Can the business accept the risks of undertaking a given activity? Accreditation documentation only needs to contain the information needed to enable this decision. Clearly, any accreditation activity which just generates documentation that’s never read is not adding value, nor helping to secure information. When performed well, accreditation helps risk owners have confidence that all aspects of a system’s security have been appropriately considered, and that proper through-life security processes are in place to maintain information security. Experience has shown that the licensing model for software is not an accurate gauge for the security of the finished item. There are very securely developed open source projects and proprietary products. The opposite is also true. The experience and competence of those developing code is of primary importance. The same considerations should be given to the security of open source products as are applied to proprietary code. The Open Source toolkit has more information. There are 3 problems with this statement. Firstly, CESG don’t accredit products – they provide assurance in the security properties of products and certify them when they meet various standards. Secondly, only those products which provide a security enforcing function need to be evaluated and certified by CESG; products like switches or email servers don’t need to be CESG-certified. Finally, CESG certification of a product is a component of risk management – it doesn’t absolve an organisation of their responsibilities to information security. While using certified products should certainly speed up the risk management process, it isn’t mandatory. Restricted systems can be built today using assured commodity security products – many of which are found natively in the operating systems of modern platforms. In the past, some of the security controls which were recommended for protecting Restricted IT systems were bespoke variants of commodity products, or were “government specials”. The requirements which drove these choices are no longer relevant given advances in commodity IT, and better approaches are available to provide an equivalent level of security, but with enhanced usability and overall cost of ownership. Foundation grade assured products are appropriate for the protection of these systems, and commodity security products (including open source) can achieve this grade of certification. Sometimes it’s obvious that attackers are going to be interested in getting hold of your sensitive information – it has clear value to someone. However, immediate financial reward isn’t the only reason government IT systems get attacked. Attackers may be disgruntled insiders, seeking to disrupt or embarrass an organisation. Attacks may come from protest groups, seeking a platform for their views. Or attacks may seek to use one system as a point to launch attacks on another – so you might not be the primary target, but might unwittingly be a conduit to them. Are you specifically being targeted? Maybe not – but your systems and internet presence probably are being attacked on a daily basis for a wide range of reasons. Asking a someone to build an “IL3 system” or to “protect at IL5” is a misuse of the Business Impact Level framework, and will generally cause confusion and an ineffective approach to securing information. Business Impact Levels are intended to help organisations to think about the consequences of certain events, and thus steer where effort should be used when managing information risks. There is no standard set of technical, procedural or personnel controls for any particular Impact Level, and so specifying requirements in terms of Impact Levels is unclear and inaccurate. Instead, security requirements should be defined in terms of the level of protection that each information asset should be given, and expectations around its through-life protection. It’s true that if you are building a system which handles many records, the impact of loss of many of them is likely to be higher than loss of one or two. Although Business Impact Levels are often misused as shorthand for protective markings, there is no direct mapping from Impact Level to protective marking. In the IL3 aggregated to IL4 example, rather than building a system capable of storing confidential records, it’s likely to be acceptable to simply add some simple additional controls around the data store, to reduce the risk of a bulk loss of data.","description":"Protecting information from valid threats to its confidentiality, integrity and availability is an enabler of digital services.

This means that assurance is proactive, ongoing and helps keep the service on track. The governance principles for digital services outline how to keep governance work on track in a similar way. A phase based approach to service development helps to increase the chances of success with in built assurance throughout each stage. Assurance should support delivery (only do something if it adds value) and be proportionate to each phase. Agile, user centred delivery is incremental, with delivery occurring every few weeks. In the early phases, you’ll be creating prototypes, and you’ll be delivering a live service for testing in the later phases. Regular delivery means that: you can test what you’ve produced to see how well it’s meeting user needs — this is the best form of assurance there are regular opportunities to adjust or stop the work as you progress and as the results of testing become known  Visual management is built into Agile approaches. This supports ongoing assurance because progress is visible to anyone. It also means that: People who govern need to go and see things for themselves to judge progress. Doing this regularly is part of assurance — it ensures there won’t be any surprises. This is the best way to understand how user needs are being met and to be reassured that delivery will be successful. At the beginning of a service delivery, you have most to learn. Using a phase based delivery approach significantly reduces risk because: early phases are about experimenting, learning and prototyping to decrease uncertainty about what to build and how to build it there’s an early and continuous focus on meeting user needs — this makes sure the right thing gets built an early focus on investigating major risks and dependencies reduces the chances of them later affecting delivery early phases have bounded time and cost but variable scope — this forces everyone to focus on the most important areas to be investigated  there are opportunities to try out different assurance, reporting and governance approaches and team composition to see what works and what doesn’t before things scale up — this helps set the project up for success It’s also important to assure governance as well as development, particularly early in the life of the service — this is where the pattern of governance is formed and it’s vital to get it right. Agile approaches have a set of processes and ‘assets’ (eg data produced by teams, daily stand up meetings, walls displaying information). You can use these for assurance — there’s no need to ask for anything in addition to this — this just creates extra work and doesn’t add value. When using Agile methods, planning happens: This regular planning gives assurance that: Regular show and tells allow delivery teams to demonstrate their progress. They also allow people who govern to go and see what’s being delivered for themselves. This is another useful form of assurance because they can: Assurers can also see governance in action at show and tells and so assess its effectiveness. Other Agile processes useful for assurance are: When there are multiple teams working on a service — or a set of related services — Agile ways of working support assurance. Activities like cross-team show and tells and the ‘stand up of stand ups’ help multiple teams communicate to make sure dependencies, risks and opportunities are being managed.

Service integration models have been around for some time, but are now evolving from the challenges of managing a small number of large suppliers (typically systems integrators) to a model of managing a greater number of smaller suppliers, often providing commodity services. For the model to be effective the component services need to be well defined and understood. It’s important to avoid any ambiguity about the boundaries of both responsibilities and accountabilities. Key features of an effective model are: The level of service integration will differ depending on the complexity of the business services and/or customers that are being supported, and the complexity of the services that are being delivered to those businesses. As the services and businesses become more critical or complex, the level of service integration becomes deeper.  The design of the service integration function will differ by department. It may be completely operated in-house. Or it might consist of a thin in-house capability ultimately responsible for the integrated end to end operation and management of quality IT services, underpinned by outsourced integration services for specific elements – for example performance monitoring, service desk, or service level reporting. The G-Cloud framework offers a number of services to support service integration. Particularly for smaller departments and simple services, care needs to be taken not to over-engineer the service integration approach – effective use of commodity standards-based IT should mean that integration and support requirements are much less onerous than managing a locked-down bespoke system. As part of service integration, you should maintain an accurate service catalogue including a service dependency map, so that you can effectively manage changes that are high risk, high impact, or that can affect multiple suppliers. When buying in services you should retain the contractual authority to ensure suppliers follow your service integration processes – so that you can ensure the integrity and availability of a department’s user services. This could include an end-to-end service performance incentive model so all suppliers collectively share in the benefits and penalties of a joint performance management regime.","description":"Service integration and management lets an organisation manage the service providers in a consistent and efficient way, making sure that performance across a portfolio of multi-sourced goods and services meets user needs.","link":"/service-manual/technology/service-integration.html"},{"_type":"manual_section","organisations":["government-digital-service"],"manual":"/service-manual","title":"Government Service Design Manual: Service management","indexable_content":"Agile and service management ITIL The importance of implementation Other frameworks exist Problematic concepts Further reading Service Strategy Service Design Service Transition Service Operation Continual Service Improvement Functions An example – service transition Projects Business as usual Individuals and interactions over processes and tools Working software over comprehensive documentation Customer collaboration over contract negotiation Responding to change over following a plan IT service management Service portfolio management Financial management for IT services Demand management Business relationship management Design coordination Service Catalogue management Service level management Availability management Capacity Management IT service continuity management Information security management system Supplier management Transition planning and support Change management Service asset and configuration management Release and deployment management Service validation and testing Change evaluation Knowledge management Event management Incident management Request fulfillment Problem management Identity management Service operations Technical management Application management Operations management ISO/IEC 20000 Microsoft Operations Framework Functions in service management ITIL on Wikipedia Introduction to ITIL v3 Discussion of DevOps and ITIL Discussion of ITIL and Continuous Delivery    Put in place a sustainable multidisciplinary team that can design, build and operate the service, led by a suitably skilled and senior service manager with decision-making responsibility.

A service is a means of delivering value to customers by facilitating outcomes customers want to achieve.     Make sure that you have the capacity and technical flexibility to update and improve the service on a very frequent basis.     continuously update and improve the service on the basis of user feedback, performance data, changes to best practice and service demand  The Digital by Default standard says that organisations should (emphasis on operate added): Put in place a sustainable multidisciplinary team that can design, build and operate the service, led by a suitably skilled and senior service manager with decision-making responsibility. This implies a change to how many organisations have traditionally run services, often with a team or organisation building a service separate from the one running it. This change however does not mean ignoring existing good practice when it comes to service management. The principles of IT service management (ITSM) and those of agile do not necessarily conflict – issues can arise however when organisations implement rigid processes without considering wider service delivery matters, or design and build services without thinking about how they will be operated. The agile manifesto makes the case for: It is too easy to position service management as opposed to agile as traditional service management practices can be viewed as focusing on processes, tools, documentation, planning and contract negotiation – the items on the right hand side of the points above. However, the agile manifesto goes on to say: That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more. To build and run a successful service you will need to work on suitable processes and manage third party relationships. Using existing service management frameworks (especially as a starting point) is one approach to this problem. ITIL (the Information Technology Infrastructure Library) is one such framework. ITIL does a particularly good job of facilitating shared language. For instance it’s definition of a service is: A service is a means of delivering value to customers by facilitating outcomes customers want to achieve. The current version of ITIL currently provides 5 volumes and 26 processes describing in detail various aspects of service management: ITIL also describes four functions that should cooperate together to form an effective service management capability. The above processes and functions make for an excellent high level list of topics to discuss when establishing an operating model for your service, whether or not you adopt the formal methods. In many cases if you have well understood, well established and well documented processes in place for all of the above you should be in a good position to run your service. When looking to combine much of the rest of guidance on the service manual with ITIL or other service management frameworks it is important to challenge existing implementations. This is less about the actual implementation and more often about the problems that implementation was designed to originally solve. As an example ITIL talks a great deal about Service Transition – getting working functionality into the hands of the users of the service. This is a key topic for The Digital Service Standard too which says that teams should: Make sure that you have the capacity and technical flexibility to update and improve the service on a very frequent basis. GOV.UK for instance made more than 100 production releases during its first two weeks after launch. This high rate of change tends to challenge existing processes designed for a slower rate of change. If you are releasing your service every month or every 6 months then a manual process (like a weekly or monthly in-person change approval board or CAB) may be the most suitable approach. If you’re releasing many times a day then the approach to how change is evaluated, tested and managed tends towards being more automated. This moves effort from occasional but manual activities to upfront design and automation work. More work is put in to assure the processes rather than putting all the effort into assuring a specific transition. Service management frameworks tend to acknowledge this, for instance ITIL has a concept of a standard change (something commonly done, with known risks and hence pre-approved), but a specific implementation in a given organisation might not. It is important to note that other service management frameworks and standards exist, including some that are of a similar size and scope to ITIL: Many organisations also use smaller processes and integrate them together. The needs of your service and organisation will determine what works best for you. Some traditional language tends to cause some confusion when discussing service management alongside agile. It’s generally best to avoid the following terms when possible, although given their widespread usage this isn’t always possible. It is however worth being aware of the problems these concepts raise. Projects tend to imply a start and an end. The main goal of project work is to complete it, to reach the end. Especially for software development the project can too often be viewed as done when the software is released. What happens after that is another problem entirely – and often someone else’s problem. However when building services the main goal is to meet user needs. These needs may change over time, and are only met by software that is running in production and available to those users. This doesn’t mean not breaking work down into easily understandable parts, but stories, sprints and epics are much more suited to agile service delivery. The concept of business as usual also clashes with a model of continuous service improvement.

Outside government, organisations in the public and private sector are learning that experienced and highly skilled managers (often called product managers in the commercial world) are necessary to deliver high-quality digital services. We are adopting that model, requiring each transactional digital service handling over 100,000 transactions each year to be developed, operated and continually improved by a service manager. These are not technical IT posts, nor are they confined to running a website. Instead, they are individuals who work full-time to develop and deliver all the changes necessary to provide effective digital services. With a handful of exceptions, this is a new role within government. These service managers will: This will depend on the scale of the service you are working on.  In some cases the service manager will also be able to fulfil the role of product manager – working closely with the delivery team (the ‘makers’), prioritising stories for each sprint, attending daily stand ups, being on hand to comment on solutions as they emerge, and accepting stories once they are delivered. However, in many cases it is likely that the service manager won’t have the capacity to be this hands-on, so they are likely to need a dedicated product manager.

These will help you to understand how we approach design. You should keep these in mind when designing and building your service, always thinking about how to make the service simpler, clearer and faster. At alpha stage, the important thing is to make something and make it quickly, before testing it with real users. You should follow the design principles and should spend your time working on the user journey, interface and experience, but you don’t need to worry about making everything pixel perfect in your prototype. At beta the main priority is creating a simpler, clearer, faster service. You should concentrate on making the user journey and experience as simple and clear as possible. However, you should  be moving towards a finalised look and feel, how fast you achieve this depends on the size of your design team and how much time you can dedicate to it. Before your service goes live it must look and feel like GOV.UK.  You should be using the correct typography, header and footer and if necessary should have followed the guidance on pictures and icons. Throughout the process of creating your service you should refer to the design principles, think of the user and design for simplicity. The user experience across all services on GOV.UK should be consistent. Your service is on GOV.UK if it’s either at www.gov.uk/myservice, myservice.service.gov.uk or myblog.blog.gov.uk. At the point of launch it should look like GOV.UK and should have the GOV.UK logotype, including the crown. You can still follow the guidance if your service isn’t on GOV.UK, but your site shouldn’t identify as being part of GOV.UK and shouldn’t use the crown or the GOV.UK logotype in the header. This blog post talks about a good example of a site that follows our design patterns without using the logo. Services should use clear, easy to read type, with consistent styles and a clear hierarchy of information. You’ll be given access to the New Transport typeface if your service is on GOV.UK. The GOV.UK elements page has more information about typography. In most cases your service will not need to use pictures. You should only use icons if they are clear, simple and help to convey information more clearly than text alone could. You should use the standard template for your header and footer if your service is on GOV.UK.

When building services around patterns and consistency, it’s important to share your frontend assets so that they can be easily reused as required. There are two more benefits to this approach: The templates on GOV.UK are constantly changing as we react to user feedback and evolving best practice, so the best place to find them is by looking at the code we publish: The GOV.UK template is a project that provides the GOV.UK header and footer, as well as associated assets. It generates a variety of output formats and you can extend it with more depending on the language your service is written in. GOV.UK’s static consumes the Ruby version of the template application, which in turn provides shared resources like footer links across the various frontend apps that run GOV.UK. The Performance Platform’s Node.js application uses the Mustache version of the template. You should be able to become a consumer of the template in exactly the same way these two projects are, by adding it to your application’s dependencies. The service manual article on Sass repositories has more information on this repository. GDS is continuously improving GOV.UK, which means that template and asset code changes regularly. All services on GOV.UK are expected to keep their templates and assets updated. How you do this will depend on how your frontend is implemented, but if you include the template and the toolkit as dependencies in your application it should be relatively easy to update as GDS publishes new versions. Please contact the GDS team for help or advice.","description":"Shared asset libraries are helpful for using the same frontend and\nbranding on multiple services.","link":"/service-manual/user-centred-design/resources/shared-asset-libraries.html"},{"_type":"manual_section","organisations":["government-digital-service"],"manual":"/service-manual","title":"Government Service Design Manual: Standalone mobile apps","indexable_content":"The government’s position on apps Types of apps Reasons for government’s position Exceptions Further reading Native apps Responsive web design Setting out your proposal The process device-specific ‘download and install’ apps (aka native apps) websites that respond to various screen sizes (aka responsive websites, web apps or HTML5) various combinations of the two generate revenue (download and buy) have a constant presence on device can access all functions on a device better performance in general can be used offline, in some cases expensive to develop and maintain needs several different versions (Android, iPhone, iPad, Blackberry etc) service iteration is more complex (at least 3 types of app to deploy) can only be downloaded via gatekeeper app stores (Apple, Google) most apps are rarely downloaded, and even then hardly used it’s your website, so costs are minimised and service iteration simplified uses open standards (HTML5) no gatekeepers to restrict access performance is maintained mobile web exceeding the reach of mobile apps clear winning strategy for ‘utility’ services which do not require complex device features or persistence not continuously on device some device features unavailable (camera, address book) requires internet connection not snappy enough for some complex services (eg Spotify, Facebook, Skype) no ‘download and buy’ revenue stream condition 1 – your web service is already designed to be responsive condition 2 – the service or the content you’re looking to build an app for is already open to third-parties via APIs or as open data what’s the user need? which third-party native/hybrid apps have already been developed to meet this user need?            if there are none and condition 2 has been met, please provide your thoughts on why this might be the case       if there are third-party alternatives, please state why you believe a government-developed app is required         if there are none and condition 2 has been met, please provide your thoughts on why this might be the case if there are third-party alternatives, please state why you believe a government-developed app is required is this user need of sufficient importance to (your users to) justify the lifetime cost of your proposed app?            if you believe it is, how have you determined this?

(please provide supporting evidence, eg analytics data that shows proportion of visitors to your content/service that currently access it using relevant devices) Tom Loosemoore’s blog post about standalone apps    “Standalone mobile apps will only be considered once the core web service works well on mobile devices, and if specifically agreed with the Cabinet Office”  The government’s position is that native apps are currently rarely justified. At the October 2012 Digital Leaders meeting, the position was clarified: native apps could not be developed without Cabinet Office approval. The November 2012 Digital Strategy says: “Standalone mobile apps will only be considered once the core web service works well on mobile devices, and if specifically agreed with the Cabinet Office” Making sure your service meets the Digital by Default Service Standard means it will work well on mobile devices. Making your data and application programming interface (API) available for reuse will stimulate the market if there is real demand for native apps. So-called ‘apps’ come in several different forms, which makes confusion understandable. When people are talking about ‘apps’, they can mean: Native apps are downloadable software applications that run using the device’s operating system code and APIs. Native apps remain on the device and can access all the hardware features (camera, storage, phone capabilities etc). Because they run using native code, different versions must be created for each operating system. Examples of native apps include Spotify, Angry Birds, Instagram, and Skype. Pros of native apps: Cons of native apps: Responsive web design is a design approach that optimises users’ viewing experiences across a wide range of devices. When a responsive website is accessed via a mobile phone, it’s sometimes referred to as a ‘mobile web app’. Responsive websites are built using open web standards (HTML, CSS, JavaScript etc) and they run inside a device’s web browser. Examples include GOV.UK, PM’s dashboard, Financial Times app, and BBC Sport. Pros of responsive web design: Cons of responsive web design: If there’s a market for native apps, why should government monopolise it? There’s a vibrant market of third party native app developers using government data and APIs. The government’s position is that native and hybrid apps are currently rarely justified. GDS back open standards – this removes the risk of having to create different, yet similar, versions of a service so an app is compatible with new devices that enter the market. While people spend as much time using apps as using mobile web, the vast majority of app use is for gaming and social networking. For ‘utility’ needs, such as those met by government services, the mobile web is preferred to native apps. GDS recognise that there’ll be a few exceptions. To help you assess whether your case is likely to be considered an exception, consider if you’ve met the following conditions: If these conditions are not in place, it’s unlikely that your app proposal will be approved. If you believe there are compelling reasons why these conditions have not been met, please set them out in your proposal. In your proposal, please provide answers and evidence on the following: In addition to the evidence requested above, all digital spend for the development of standalone mobile apps is subject to the GDS spend approval.

Status: Research required Start pages consist of: There’s a start page template in the GOV.UK Prototype Kit. The name of the service should tell people what it lets them do and who it’s for. Avoid acronyms and noun phrases. The best service names start with a verb, like “Pay your car tax”. This should be no more than a few lines. Focus on things that most users will definitely need to know. For example, costs, or required documents. There’s no need to mention something that people will already know or assume. Don’t try to get across complex eligibility criteria. Instead, deal with these inside the service itself. This button text should contain a clear call to action to start the service. If the service is not hosted on GOV.UK then this should be made clear. Use this to tell people about other ways that people can access the service.

However, thought still needs to be given to the survey design, understanding the goal(s) of the survey , and how the results will be used. In order to increase the effectiveness of the survey, it is important to include an introduction that explains the purpose of the survey to potential respondents. Make it clear what the survey will be used for, and how it will help improve the service. As it’s unlikely that it will be possible to include monetary incentives, it’s important the introduction is worded in a manner that increases the likelihood that people will want to take part. It is also recommended that people are informed of how long the survey will take to complete as this will reduce drop out rate (people who start the survey but don’t finish). Screener questions should be placed at the beginning of surveys to ensure that the correct people take the survey eg demographic information, reason for visiting etc. Quotas may also be set so that you can control the number of people taking the survey that fall into a specific demographic group or audience type. A typical user survey will be structured in the following manner: Surveys are normally composed of the following types of questions: Single response (these type of questions allow the respondent to select just one answer) eg: Q. What is your gender? Multiple choice questions (respondents can select more than one answer) eg: Q. Why did you visit more than one area of the site today (please tick all that apply)? Open ended questions (respondents can write a text response) Q. You rated ‘ease of using the site’ as fair or poor. Please tell us why you gave this rating? Scale questions (respondents are asked if they agree/disagree with a statement) Q. The site was easy to use Once you have decided on the questions that you want to be included, it is necessary to set up the question logic so that respondents are routed through the questionnaire correctly.

These are only interpretations and there is no one way of doing it. At GDS, we are framework- and methodology-agnostic. We take the tools that we need to from a range of techniques and use the most appropriate for the project and team to help support them to deliver. This means that not all teams will be working in exactly the same way. These are the four categories of people that might want to learn more about agile, the content in the more detailed sections below is repeated where it is relevant to multiple categories of people: Agile delivery practitioner (and those wanting to be) These people need to use agile every day and help teach others. Typical roles are: Delivery team members: if you are becoming part of a delivery team This covers any other people who’ll be part of an agile team, eg: People who govern and stakeholders: if you are going to be a member of a governance team or a stakeholder for an agile project These people are senior responsible officers (SROs), project leads, directors and those responsible for supporting an agile project. Typical roles are: Interested others: if you are just interested in finding out more This covers anyone that has an interest in understanding what it means to work in an agile way. Formal training is only one part of learning, as with most new skills. With agile delivery management in particular, training will only give you the foundations of some of the techniques, but the real learning comes from doing. It’s important that the organisational culture is set up to support learning and experimenting. Think about ways to start getting hands on experience as quickly as possible. This can come through: Shadowing / learning from others You can learn a lot from seeing others who are practicing agile techniques. Because teams are open and transparent, they should be happy to invite you into planning, review and retrospective sessions. You should also try to spend some time shadowing or working with delivery practitioners on problems to give you a better understanding of how they apply agile. Try to invite external speakers in to share their own experiences with you and your department and take the chance to discuss your ideas with them. Formal training Training courses are useful to help understand theory, but it’s important to remember that there is no one answer to how to run every project and that training does not equal learning. It’s worthwhile to learn a number of tools and techniques and strengthen your understanding with self-initiated learning and doing. Some options to think about when training are: Refer to the Civil Service Learning portal to book formal classroom training as a civil servant Self-initiated learning (networking, reading blogs) You can teach yourself through self-initiated learning, networking and reading books and blogs.  The first thing you should read is the agile section of the Service Design Manual. Networking is a useful way of learning. You can also find local meetups and events close to you at www.meetup.com or you could start your own. There are hundreds of blogs about agile and lean techniques with lots to learn. Subscribe to ones that you think are interesting. GDS also has an agile delivery community links list that’s updated regularly, which you can subscribe to. It’s also worth having a look to see if there are any relevant collections on the links collection service paper.li as well as other web collections of links. Sharing ideas and support (community, blogging, public speaking) Once you’re confident, teaching others is a good way to learn. Try engaging in communities like those on LinkedIn, blogging on your own and others’ blogs about agile or speaking about your experiences internally, at meetups or events. Small experiments and running short projects The best learning can come from doing. Agile techniques can be applied to many types of projects and are not restricted to software. This means that you can quickly start to learn as a team through running small projects. Take a project that you’re working on and start to apply agile techniques to it, then improve on them as you go. You can learn a lot from being unsuccessful: the phrase “fail fast” is often used in an agile context, but what you can benefit from is learning quickly. Questioning and retrospecting You’ll learn a lot through asking questions and there is an agile tool that helps you to do this – the retrospective. This is an important part of any agile team and a good way of learning – everyone has an input. Regular retrospectives are great way to understand what works and what doesn’t, so you can think about how your learning can be directed. Pairing / Learning from others Pairing comes from the term pair programming in Extreme programming, but is just as relevant to different types of work. During this practice two people will sit together to work on the same thing at the same time. One of you is writing the code or doing the task, and the other is observing and giving input. The benefits of working in this way lead to better quality of code, better communication amongst the team and learning how something is built and why decisions were made. Pairing will rapidly increase learning as an individual and as a team.

You can also find local meetups and events close to you at meetup.com or you could start your own. There are hundreds of blogs about agile and lean techniques with lots to learn. Subscribe to ones that you think are interesting. GDS also has an agile delivery community links list that’s updated regularly, which you can subscribe to. It’s also worth having a look to see if there are any relevant collections on the links collection service paper.li. Formal training If you’re interested in finding out more, you could try a course that gives you an introduction to agile and its benefits. Try to make sure that it’s a broad course that covers more than one methodology or framework. You can use the Civil Service Learning portal to book formal classroom training as a civil servant.","description":"When we refer to agile, we are referring to a culture of:","link":"/service-manual/agile/training-and-learning.html"},{"_type":"manual_section","organisations":["government-digital-service"],"manual":"/service-manual","title":"Government Service Design Manual: User-centred design in alpha and beta","indexable_content":"Designers and researchers are essential Researching in design iterations Build Measure Learn Fortnightly user research (eg ‘Testing Tuesday’) Guerrilla research Other research methods Analysis Share your findings Communicating Before the session During the session Affinity sorting Actions Prioritisation Video Showcase Consider your more distant stakeholders Publish the design as it stands Retrospectives keep your team concentrating on real user needs help teams design products which are prioritised by user needs help teams iterate products in response to user feedback they’re sharing all the knowledge that’s been gathered about users, so any decisions made on the product design will be influenced by real user insights the researcher can provide more information and more regular feedback — helping the entire team to iterate and prioritise, and create the best possible product they’ll continually create experiments that allow them to test and prove whether or not design approaches create products that users find understandable and desirable build measure learn it’s usually quite quick to create prototypes of design concepts in code doing so will usually gain more helpful insights from users than paper prototypes allows time for making tweaks and small changes reduces the risk of technical failures in the research sessions have people interact with the design you have been working on (usability testing) explore any specific issues you‘d like to gather more information on through a depth interview (one-on-one interviews that produce deep insights on user needs and behaviours) your own offices a research laboratory (get one from a commercial supplier if there’s not one readily available) define your research questions — what do you want to learn from the round of user testing?

Do it continuously through each stage — don’t leave it as something that happens at the beginning and end of phases. Doing user research continuously will: Each team needs to have a designer and a researcher working together, both having an active interest in the design and user insight. This isn’t about a user researcher ‘testing’ the work of the designer — having designers and researchers work together means that: Make sure that you have a team member leading on research that sits with the team. They may also do other work (design, write content etc), but are also responsible for running research at least every 2 weeks. Don’t spend more than 2 weeks working on design without testing it with real end users. Each 2-week iteration should comprise of 3 stages:  With every iteration, create materials to be included in the next round of research. In the alpha and beta phases, these will typically be prototypes that vary in accuracy — from paper prototypes through to working prototypes in code. Use existing GDS code and other open source frameworks as: Accept that you’ll design and build a number of prototypes to test with end users, and that these prototypes will be thrown away. This gives the team freedom to explore a range of different concepts and gain a better understanding of what works best for end users. Allow time for these experiments particularly in the early stages of the project. In the early stages of your project the prototype will probably look unfinished and the design will still require a lot of work. Stick to the ‘test every 2 weeks’ rule, instead of waiting until you’re completely happy with the design or have something that feels finished. Try to make sure that the prototype is completed at least 24 hours before your testing sessions begin, as it: There are many ways to create ‘experiments’ that will help you to answer questions about your product, your end users and your design ideas. Your researcher will help choose the best research methods for answering each question. With their help, you’ll probably end up using a number of different techniques on your project. Whatever your project, be sure to do fortnightly user research. In these sessions you’re able to: Carry out research sessions with users every 2 weeks on the same day. Doing user testing at predictable and regular intervals means that your team members will be able to schedule time to watch sessions. A good approach is to schedule 5 one-on-one interviews for that day, each interview being 1 hour in duration. (Schedule a 6th participant as a ‘spare’ in case some participants don’t attend earlier in the day or you have a poorly recruited participant). Conduct these sessions in either: Make sure that you have both facilities booked and participants recruited as early in your project as possible for the expected duration of the alpha and beta phases. To prepare for these sessions, you need to: Prepare your prototype for the sessions by making sure that it’s: In each user testing session: A day of research should be followed by a period of analysis before making any significant design changes. The analysis stage is described in detail below. You can use the time between more formal testing to conduct some guerrilla-style testing, getting some initial feedback on your revised designs. Guerrilla testing normally involves taking your prototype into a coffee shop or other public location and finding volunteers who’ll give you some quick feedback. Guerrilla testing participants aren’t necessarily representative of your target audience, but they can provide a quick sense-check in between formal testing sessions. There are many other research methods you can use to supplement your ‘in person’ qualitative research and to address specific research questions. Using a different technique can provide better insight into a particular research question, or validate insights from fortnightly research with a larger audience. Here‘s a list of some techniques you can use and information on how and when you should use them. Now it’s time to see what you can learn from your user testing and research. Make the best possible use of this information by: It’s important to properly debrief after spending a day doing user testing as you’ll have seen a lot of people and a lot of different reactions. Although it takes time to analyse sessions in detail, doing so means that you’ll: To do this correctly, you need to: At this stage you’re aiming to create a full set of insights (things that you’ve observed and learned), so don’t start designing solutions just yet. You should allow several hours for this analysis process. Work with anyone that’s seen the user testing session to analyse observations, as it will help to:  Decide what you’re going to do about each finding, if anything, and when you’ve proven a theory, make sure that it’s recorded and shared with the project team. If a finding needs further action, determine what is required to address it in the next design iteration. Write this on an orange post-it note and stick it on top of the finding. When you’ve decided on what actions to take, use a prioritisation method (like dot voting) to decide how you’ll spend your efforts for the next iteration. Put user testing findings and actions in a place that’s easily accessible to the project team, as it’s likely that you’ll come back to the findings to: You can document your findings for others to see in many different ways, like using a: It’s also useful to keep a record of what you tested with users, eg if you’ve prototyped in code, keep a folder in your repository for each round. You may also like to keep screenshots of the prototype. GDS intend to create a format for sharing research findings between projects across government. While GDS work on the best way to do this, keep your research findings in an accessible shared format so findings can be shared and learned from in the future. The findings should, wherever possible, be easily understood with no need for an explanation. Move any actions onto your story wall so that the whole team can see what you’re working on and who’s working on it. Use videos to demonstrate findings and store the session videos in a safe place, ideally where they can be found and watched by team members. If you store the videos on a public service (like Vimeo), make sure they are adequately protected. You need to discuss the project and its progress with others. You can do this by: Just as a product team often presents a showcase at the end of each iteration, so should the research and design team. This will make sure the wider project team has an understanding of: This is an opportunity for members of the project team to catch up if they haven’t been able to attend user testing sessions, as well as an opportunity to ask questions. Depending on how your team works, you might put your presentation into the project team’s showcase or you may have a showcase just for research and design. There may be other people beyond your more immediate project team who are interested in the outcomes of your work. You can communicate and/or work together with these people by: Make it possible for your team to always access the latest version of the prototype, but make sure it’s appropriately protected. Team members may need to check something or use the prototype to talk about the project with their own stakeholders. Put a message across the top of the prototype to remind people that it’s a work in progress. It’s important to reflect on your progress at regular intervals. Schedule a retrospective where research and design team members have the chance to discuss the process openly and can suggest changes to the process. Assign owners and due dates to the actions to make sure that change occurs.","description":"Carry out user research during every stage of your project.

Surveys can be conducted either face to face by a trained moderator or through self-completion (online, postal etc) in order to quantify thoughts/beliefs, behaviours, ownership etc. Surveys can be a relatively cheap and quick way of gathering and quantifying public opinion and monitoring change over time. Surveys can be used to size a market to find out how many people own a product, or take part in an activity eg how many people use the Internet in the UK. They can be also used to understand usage and attitudes towards a product or activity eg how often people use the Internet, how they access it, why the use it etc. Complex analysis can be also be conducted to understand key drivers of attitude/behaviour, segmentation of audiences, and trade offs between different opinions etc. Surveys provide a snapshot of opinion, and are a useful method for monitoring uptake, usage and attitudes over time. Self-completion surveys used to obtain information from web users. Surveys are activated when a user interacts with a page – this can either be through arriving/leaving a page, or clicking on a link. Software is used to control the  proportion of users who are invited to take a specific survey. In order to increase completion rates, online surveys are normally no longer than 5 to 10 minutes in length (approximately 20 to 25 questions). These are identical in set up and design to online web surveys, except participants are asked to complete them via an email, and not at random when they visit a website. Email surveys are often more targeted as participants can be identified by information already known about the them eg demographic, information usage etc. Online or email surveys are normally the cheapest method as these can be conducted in-house using inexpensive or free survey software, inviting people to take part from their own website, or using a database of email addresses. Like telephone interviews, face to face interviews are structured and conducted by a trained moderator. Unlike other survey methods, respondents may be shown limited stimulus – eg an advert, a leaflet cover or a website design. Face to face interviews also enable researchers to target respondents more easily by demographic, geographic and socio-economic group. Structured interviews that are conducted over the phone by a trained moderator. Telephone and face interviews are the most costly methodology and they are normally conducted by a third party agency. Although surveys can be a quick and cheap manner in which to conduct user research, they often: All surveys, regardless of methodology, should use a robust sample that is nationally representative or representative of an audience of interest. Most nationally representative surveys are 1,000 people or more, but can be significantly larger if there are a number of distinct user groups that are being targeted. It is important that the delivery channel used considers the target audience. For example in the recent Digital Landscape research an online and face-to-face methodology was used as both online and offline audiences needed to be interviewed – an online only methodology would have excluded those who are offline, and the opinions of this audience omitted from the research. It is also important to note that performing research with hard-to-reach groups can be more time consuming and costly (eg black and minority ethnic, people with disabilities).","description":"Surveys contain closed ended questions with fixed responses such as ‘yes’, ‘no’, ‘very satisfied’ to ‘very dissatisfied’, ‘excellent’ to ‘poor’ etc, and open ended questions that allow respondents to provide written responses.","link":"/service-manual/user-centred-design/user-research/user-research-surveys.html"},{"_type":"manual_section","organisations":["government-digital-service"],"manual":"/service-manual","title":"Government Service Design Manual: User research tools","indexable_content":"Survey tools Remote user testing tools Card sorting tools Online focus groups Community groups Text analysis tool    Please note: Examples are illustrative, rather than recommendations, and we suggest checking G-Cloud regularly to see if any similar services are available using that framework.

Regular user research helps to make sure that we start and stay aligned with real user needs. User researchers are involved at all phases of the project and work closely and collaboratively with designers and product owners. In the early stages of discovery they assist in developing a clear understanding and empathy for end users, making sense of existing research and commissioning or conducting additional research. Through the Alpha and Beta phases they work closely with the design team to provide guidance based on their understanding of end user needs and behaviour, and working with the team to design methods to answer outstanding questions about the users and the design of the service being created. As a member of the delivery team, you should hire researchers who are comfortable working in an agile team, delivering continuous research in fortnightly iterations. Especially in alpha and beta phases, you will get better results by bringing a researcher into your team rather than outsourcing research to 3rd party. In particular you should look for a researcher who has experience contributing to other disciplines in the team. Capabilities in design or content are particularly helpful. In product development a mixture of experience in both qualitative and quantitative research is useful, although the most essential will be the ability to design and conduct qualitative research. Teams should aim to observe real users interacting with the product they are designing at least every two weeks, most often in the form of one-on-one interviews. When hiring a user researcher there are two main things to consider. Firstly consider whether they have sufficient experience in designing, facilitating and analysing user research, in particular one-on-one interviews and usability testing. A researcher with hours of experience observing end users interacting with digital products can bring value to the design team immediately. Most experienced researchers should be able to provide you with an estimate of their total hours of experience observing users and, on request, provide video clips showing examples of their facilitation techniques for you to review. You are looking for a researcher who has 100+ hours of facilitation experience and who demonstrates an empathetic yet methodical approach to facilitation. Secondly, consider their ability to work well in an agile team. This means that they need to be able to work collaboratively with designers and product owners, to be flexible and responsive in designing research and comfortable with a fast moving work environment where change is constant, and most importantly, they need to have experience and ability in quickly and effectively communicating research insights in an actionable way so that these insights actively shape the design and development of the product. This will usually mean that the researcher has exercised some creativity and experimentation in their method of communicating findings and they should be able to share examples that were more and less successful.

Find out more about asking for an email address Use this option for services with a social element or in combination with the email option. You can have the service create a username for people from a reference number or similar. Only use this option for infrequent, short term interactions like checking the status of a transaction. Some people will wish to change their username. For example if it’s an email address that’s no longer available for them or it reflects a name that they no longer use. If people will be signing in to your service more than once or twice you should let them change their username or make it easy to migrate to a new account.

Make sure the core key performance indicators (KPIs) established in the service standard, and any other KPIs you choose to measure, accurately reflect the needs of your users and stakeholders. This will allow you to measure the ability of your service to meet user needs. While building your service, make sure that appropriate analytics tools are being used to monitor the service, collecting the data necessary to produce accurate and timely measurements. For more information, read our guidance on choosing analytics tools. Establish a ‘baseline’ based on the current performance trends of each channel. Use this to judge the effectiveness of any changes to your service. This will help you pinpoint the effectiveness of your initiatives, and identify what worked. Look at performance trends over time, rather than taking a snapshot at a particular point. Peaks and dips in performance can then be measured in relation to this base (or trend) line, which helps to: Collect and combine performance information from multiple sources and across multiple channels. Make sure you understand what this will mean in terms of system requirements. Combining data often reveals useful insights, eg into service efficiency (cost per transaction and total cost to serve) or the amount of usage by channel (percentage digital take-up vs post, phone etc). Communicate performance information to your users through the appropriate: Highlight specific segments that you know users are interested in, and make sure that your visualisations are simple, useful and contain minimal amounts of chartjunk. Typical segments include: By making your visualisations easy to understand you significantly increase the likelihood that the information will be used to improve your service. Best practices include: Any service that meets user needs will include an element of user feedback. Monitor this and act on it. Doing so will help to continually improve the service for your users.

The sample list of user stories provided is not intended to be a complete list of all areas of interest nor are you likely to need to do all of this for every service. The idea is for this list to be a good starting place from where to you can write additional stories, delete ones you do not require and split stories into smaller ones. Importantly you also need to provide your own acceptance criteria specific to the needs of your service. Remember these stories are a placeholder for a conversation. For some contexts, that conversation will be ‘this does not apply to my service’ – that is fine. But there will almost certainly be other stories not listed here which do apply. An issue we have observed on a number of projects is a lack of understanding early on in a project about the work required to run a large online service. Often this is placed under  hosting and is investigated too late in the process. The hosting of a complex and sensitive software application requires a team of people with specialist skills to design, setup and operate. Because this work is generally not user facing and can be highly technical it is sometimes easy to leave until later – with potentially dire consequences for launching safely and on time. Does your team have people who deeply understand this topic? If you are not an expert then it is important to involve people permanently in the team who are. They can explain the technical trade offs and decisions which may affect your service. As well as understanding the potentially large scope of work, many of the areas discussed here have lead times associated with third parties. The earlier stories related to these topics are brought into project backlogs the sooner estimates can be made and deadlines understood. The following stories are intended to provide a starting point for any project, rather than be a complete set. Individual projects would be expected to take and modify stories as needed and importantly to apply their own acceptance criteria specific to their requirements. The majority of these stories are from the point of view of developers, web operations engineers and the responsible service manager. Although not ideal, for this particular technical topic this works reasonably well. Feel free to change the focus when using them in your backlog.

Prototyping is an essential process to get a feel for the shape and edges of a product, to begin to estimate the work involved and to provide something you can quickly test with real users. This is a vital part of a process often known as ‘product discovery’: We built alpha.gov.uk as a prototype of what would later become the single domain www.gov.uk. It was built quickly without much concern to scalability, resilience, or any of the other considerations of a ‘real’ product, because none of those matter unless the core concept is sound. That allowed us to get feedback early and also understand some of the trickier concepts we would have to grapple with, like the fuzzy lines between different audiences, the operational processes that would be required, and so on. Prototyping can start on paper with sketches. Hand-drawn sketches of what a service might involve are a good way to begin thinking things through. We encourage everyone to get to running code as quickly as possible. It’s only when you start working in the same medium your users will be using (for online services that’s generally a web browser, but it may also be via an API (application programming interface)) that you can really understand the experience you need to provide. The smart answer format for GOV.UK began as a series of paper sketches refined over a week by a small team. That process gave them a good sense of the boundaries of the problem they were trying to solve. As quickly as possible we prototyped the format using HTML and JavaScript so that it could be experienced in a web browser. That revealed more constraints, such as the fact that users might expect to be able to go back and amend an answer without realising that would change their whole journey through the format. This allowed us to quickly adjust the user interface to be clearer for its users before we started the work of building out the full system. Running code also forces you to think about your integrations with other services and how they might work – do you need to send email? integrate with an existing database? and so on. A prototype will rarely actually include these integrations but having a clear picture of them is vital if you’re going to understand the real effort involved in building and operating the service.","description":"The best way to understand a product is to try to build it.

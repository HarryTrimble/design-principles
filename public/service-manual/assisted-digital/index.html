      <p>Service teams must ensure appropriate assisted digital support is in place for their service. This support must be aimed towards users who need it. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/assisted-digital/action-plan">Read more about how to develop assisted digital support that meets the Digital Service Standard</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="/service-manual/digital-by-default">Digital Service Standard</a> includes rules for how services must include assisted digital support.</p>

<p>Here you will be able to find out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>what we mean by assisted digital support</li>
  <li>who needs assisted digital support</li>
  <li>when you don’t need to provide assisted digital support</li>
  <li>how you can provide assisted digital support, including channels, responsibilities and liabilities</li>
  <li>how assisted digital, digital inclusion and digital take-up are related</li>
  <li>how to provide support during GOV.UK Verify</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="what-is-assisted-digital-support">What is assisted digital support?</h2>
<p>Assisted digital support is for people who can’t use online government services on their own. The support can be someone guiding a user through the digital service or entering a user’s information into the digital service on their behalf. It can be provided by the private, voluntary or public sectors.</p>

<p><img src="/service-manual/assets/images/ad-image.jpg" alt="Diagram showing the digital and assisted digital routes to a digital service" /></p>

<p>Assisted digital support must include advice on how to use the digital service. This could be information already on GOV.UK (or on an alternative domain for departments that are exempt from GOV.UK) about the service or the policy decisions behind it. The person giving assisted digital support must only need to use information already available to do their job.</p>

<ul>
  <li>is designed to meet well-researched user needs</li>
  <li>helps users build the skills or confidence to use the online service independently</li>
  <li>is easy for users to find - at the times and places they need it</li>
  <li>is trusted, free to use and easy to access</li>
  <li>gives a good end-to-end experience where users can successfully complete the service</li>
  <li>gives users a joined-up experience across multiple services that can be run by different government departments</li>
  <li>helps to make the digital service better</li>
  <li>is sustainably provided</li>
  <li>meets users’ accessibility and legal language requirements</li>
  <li>securely stores and handles users’ personal data in line with the Data Protection Act, ensuring users’ privacy is maintained</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/assisted-digital/action-plan.html">Find out how to research, design and deliver assisted digital support</a>.</p>

<h2 id="who-needs-assisted-digital-support">Who needs assisted digital support</h2>
<p>Every service will have a different proportion of users who need assisted digital support. You will need to <a href="/service-manual/assisted-digital/assisted-digital-user-research">carry out user research to understand your users</a>, including users of your specific service with the lowest levels of digital skills.</p>

<p><a href="https://goon-uk-prod.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/Basic%20Digital%20Skills_UK%20Report%202015_131015_FINAL.pdf">The Go ON UK Basic Digital Skills report</a> (2015) found that 23% of UK adults (around 12.6 million people) lack <a href="http://www.go-on.co.uk/get-involved/basic-digital-skills/">basic digital skills as defined by Go ON UK</a>. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/rdit2/internet-users/2015/stb-ia-2015.html">2015 ONS figures</a> state that 11% of UK adults had not used the internet at all in the last 3 months.</p>

<p>And <a href="http://resources.lloydsbank.com/insight/uk-business-digital-index/">Lloyds Bank UK Business Digital Index 2015</a> found that 1 in 3 SMEs and charities also lack basic online skills.</p>

<p>Assisted digital support needs to be available to service users in Britain, or British citizens who are living overseas, who cannot access or complete a user journey on their own, such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>people or businesses who are offline</li>
  <li>people or businesses who are online but have limited digital capability - ie low experience, skills, confidence, ability and/or motivation</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="when-you-dont-need-to-offer-assisted-digital-support">When you don’t need to offer assisted digital support</h2>
<p>Your service doesn’t need to provide assisted digital support if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>there is an alternative service (not channel) available that achieves the same outcome for users.
    <ul>
      <li>eg the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/transformation/apply-registered-traveller">Registered Traveller service</a> enables pre-approved travellers to pass through the UK border faster than the standard border process, which is a separate service that is available to them with the same outcome.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>your users are public sector employees who use your service as part of their work</li>
  <li>your users are non-British citizens overseas</li>
  <li>your service is being completed by a third party intermediary who benefits commercially for engaging with the service on behalf of the end user.
    <ul>
      <li>Note that if an intermediary is the intended end user (rather than completing the service on behalf of the end user), you may need to provide assisted digital support.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="responsibilities-and-liabilities">Responsibilities and liabilities</h2>
<p>As a service manager, you will need to make sure that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>assisted digital support is delivered within legal and policy constraints, such as the Equality Act 2010</li>
  <li>users who require assisted digital support are not charged more to use your service than those who do not</li>
  <li>your assisted digital support provides free translation and accessibility facilities, to meet relevant legal requirements</li>
</ul>

<p>You may provide users with non-financial incentives for completing the service digitally, such as later deadlines for online self assessment tax returns.</p>

<h3 id="information-accuracy">Information accuracy</h3>
<p>Assisted digital support providers are responsible for making sure that the user has a basic understanding of your service.</p>

<p>Responsibility for the accuracy of information (eg typing a passport number or date of birth) lies with either the service provider or the service user, depending on who is entering the information:</p>

<ul>
  <li>if the user enters the information, they are responsible</li>
  <li>if a support provider enters the information, they are responsible for making sure that the information is correct, even if the user can see the screen</li>
</ul>

<p>Assisted digital support providers can choose not to provide support if it can’t be done accurately, eg because of a bad phone line or if the user has a speech impairment. In such instances, the assisted digital support provider must guide the user to an appropriate alternative.</p>

<h3 id="costs-for-assisted-digital-support">Costs for assisted digital support</h3>
<p>Sometimes an assisted digital user may need to pay for the costs of accessing assisted digital support like:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the cost of travelling to an office</li>
  <li>calling a contact centre</li>
  <li>paying for printing, scanning and taking photos</li>
</ul>

<p>These costs must be in line with existing policy, for example not using higher-rate phone lines.</p>

<h2 id="routes-for-providing-assisted-digital-support">Routes for providing assisted digital support</h2>
<p>You can only provide assisted digital support in person, through web chat or over the telephone, and not on paper. This is because a user’s information will be fed directly into the digital service by the person or technology they are interacting with. This reduces administrative overheads related to double handling and re-typing.</p>

<h3 id="in-person">In person</h3>
<p>You can offer assisted digital support at the support provider’s location (eg high street or office location) or as an outreach visit (eg at the user’s home or in hospital).</p>

<p>The user sits alongside the assisted digital support provider and can see the digital service on the screen. It’s important to take this approach because it enables the user to learn digital skills and build confidence. This means the user is more likely to complete the digital service on their own in the future.</p>

<p>For the same reason, it’s preferable for users to type in their own information. Providers of in person assisted digital support may need to type the user’s information into the service if a user cannot do so themselves.</p>

<h3 id="telephone">Telephone</h3>
<p>The preferred approach to telephone support is for the assisted digital support provider to talk to the user at the same time they are trying to use your service. This will encourage the user to build their digital skills and confidence, making it more likely that they will be able to do it on their own in future.</p>

<p>Alternatively, telephone support may involve the user providing information to the assisted digital support provider to type into the digital service on their behalf.</p>

<h3 id="web-chat">Web chat</h3>
<p>Assisted digital support may be provided on screen while the user is attempting to use the digital service independently. An on-screen dialogue enables the assisted digital support provider to support the user.</p>

<h2 id="front-office-counter-services-framework">Front Office Counter Services framework</h2>
<p>When procuring for assisted digital services, departments should use the Front Office Counter Services (FOCS) framework where this provides value for money and meets user need. Where departments choose to use an alternative contractual mechanism, they should consult and agree with HM Treasury (including reasons for selecting an alternative contractual mechanism) before submitting their spend request to Cabinet Office. The Efficiency Reform Group (ERG) should seek relevant HM Treasury spending team approval on any decision not to use the FOCS framework.</p>

<h2 id="how-assisted-digital-digital-take-up-and-digital-inclusion-are-related">How assisted digital, digital take-up and digital inclusion are related</h2>
<p>Some people can use digital services but for a range of reasons prefer other channels. <a href="/service-manual/communications/increasing-digital-takeup">Digital take-up</a> is about encouraging them to start using digital government services instead.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/government-approach-to-assisted-digital">Assisted digital</a> is about supporting people who can’t use government digital services on their own.</p>

<p>Helping individuals to develop basic digital skills to make the most of being online more broadly is called <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/government-digital-inclusion-strategy/government-digital-inclusion-strategy">digital inclusion</a>.</p>

<h3 id="how-they-might-overlap">How they might overlap</h3>
<p>Assisted digital and digital inclusion both involve users who can’t use digital services on their own. Both approaches help users gain the confidence and skills to be able to use the service on their own in the future.</p>

<p>Any user that builds their digital skills and confidence to the point that they no longer require assisted digital support should then be included in your digital take-up strategy.</p>

<p>Some users may never develop the skills or confidence to be able to complete digital services independently and will always need assisted digital support.</p>

<h3 id="how-digital-take-up-users-are-different-from-assisted-digital-users">How digital take-up users are different from assisted digital users</h3>
<p>Unlike users who need assisted digital support and users for whom digital inclusion is appropriate, users for whom digital take-up approaches are appropriate can use online services, but prefer to use other channels, for a number of reasons. Service teams must find ways of encouraging their service’s users to user digital channels whenever possible.</p>

<h2 id="providing-assisted-digital-support-during-govuk-verify">Providing assisted digital support during GOV.UK Verify</h2>
<p>Service teams must ensure that assisted digital support is in place for the full user journey, including those that require <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/introducing-govuk-verify/introducing-govuk-verify">GOV.UK Verify</a></p>

<h3 id="data-and-privacy-considerations">Data and privacy considerations</h3>
<p>During in-person or telephone support, users should type in their own information where possible. If the user cannot do this then the support provider can enter the user’s information on their behalf, as long as the user is present. Users without any internet access will not be able to use GOV.UK Verify, because they must be able to see the screen where their information is being entered. Services can not proactively ask users which company they used to verify their identity.</p>

<h3 id="which-companies-can-verify-users-identity">Which companies can verify users’ identity</h3>
<p>Users can currently choose to verify with one or more <a href="https://identityassurance.blog.gov.uk/2014/12/11/what-it-means-to-be-a-certified-company/">certified companies</a>. These companies are certified by ISO and tScheme as meeting industry and government standards for security and identity assurance.</p>

<p>These companies are certified as meeting government and industry-agreed protocols and standards. They must observe the law, for example The Data Protection Act 1998.</p>

<h3 id="what-users-will-need-to-complete-govuk-verify">What users will need to complete GOV.UK Verify</h3>
<p>When verifying a user’s identity, the certified company will ask users to <a href="https://identityassurance.blog.gov.uk/2014/11/21/how-does-a-certified-company-establish-that-its-really-you/">provide evidence</a> that proves they are who they say they are. This could include information from official documents like a passport or driving licence​.</p>

<p>Certified companies might ask for <a href="https://identityassurance.blog.gov.uk/2014/11/21/how-does-a-certified-company-establish-that-its-really-you/">a range of evidence and checks</a>. No single piece of evidence is sufficient and the precise evidence required will depend on the chosen certified company.</p>

<h3 id="support-provided-by-certified-companies">Support provided by certified companies</h3>
<p>Certified companies can provide any type of support to users, and display contact telephone numbers for this support in the user journey. However, a user may call your service directly, rather than the certified company, for help with GOV.UK Verify.</p>

<h3 id="offline-identity-authentication-routes">Offline identity authentication routes</h3>
<p>GOV.UK Verify is in beta. It is being developed and expanded based on user feedback but is not able to verify everyone yet. Users who can’t be verified will need an <a href="https://identityassurance.blog.gov.uk/2015/07/13/basic-identity-accounts-trial-an-update/">alternative route to access your service</a>.</p>

<p>An alternative (usually offline) service will be necessary for users who can not use GOV.UK Verify. This include users who:</p>

<ul>
  <li>are under the age of 19</li>
  <li>have been in the UK for less than 12 months</li>
</ul>

<p>Services currently allowing users access without using GOV.UK Verify may continue using existing identity checking methods for users who fall into the categories above.</p>
